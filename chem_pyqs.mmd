\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (b) : Pressure \(=\frac{\text { Force }}{\text { Area }}\)

Therefore, dimensions of pressure \(=\frac{\mathrm{MLT}^{-2}}{\mathrm{~L}^{2}}=\mathrm{ML}^{-1} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\) and dimensions of energy per unit volume
\[
=\frac{\text { Energy }}{\text { Volume }}=\frac{\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}}{\mathrm{~L}^{3}}=\mathrm{ML}^{-1} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}
\]
2. (d) : Zeros placed left to the number are never significant, therefore the no. of significant figures for the numbers 161 cm , 0.161 cm and 0.0161 cm are same, i.e., 3 .
3. (c) : According to Avogadro's hypothesis, ratio of the volumes of gases will be equal to the ratio of their no. of moles.
So, no. of moles \(=\frac{\text { Mass }}{\text { Mol. mass }}\)
\(n_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}=\frac{w}{2} ; n_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\frac{w}{32} ; n_{\mathrm{CH}_{4}}=\frac{w}{16}\)
So, the ratio is \(\frac{w}{2}: \frac{w}{32}: \frac{w}{16}\) or \(16: 1: 2\).
4. (a) : \(\underset{1 \text { vol. }}{\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}}+\underset{5 \text { vol. }}{5 \mathrm{O}_{2}} \rightarrow \underset{3 \text { vol. }}{3} \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\underset{4 \text { vol. }}{4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\)

According to the above equation, 1 vol. or 1 litre of propane requires 5 vol . or 5 litres of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) to burn completely.
5. (b) : Weight of gas \(=0.24 \mathrm{~g}\),

Volume of gas \(=45 \mathrm{~mL}=0.045\) litre and density of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}=0.089 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}\)
Weight of 45 mL of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}=\) density × volume
\[
=0.089 \times 0.045=4.005 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~g}
\]

Therefore, vapour density
\(=\frac{\text { Weight of certain volume of substance }}{\text { Weight of same volume of hydrogen }}=\frac{0.24}{4.005 \times 10^{-3}}=59.93\)
6. (c) : If 1 L of one gas contains \(N\) molecules, 2 L of any gas under the same conditions will contain \(2 N\) molecules.
7. (c) : \(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4}+3 \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
\[
28 \mathrm{~g} \quad 96 \mathrm{~g}
\]

For complete combustion,
2.8 kg of \(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4}\) requires \(=\frac{96}{28} \times 2.8 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~g}\)
\[
=9.6 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~g}=9.6 \mathrm{~kg} \text { of } \mathrm{O}_{2}
\]
8. (d) : Average isotopic mass of \(X\)
\[
=\frac{200 \times 90+199 \times 8+202 \times 2}{90+8+2}
\]
\(=\frac{18000+1592+404}{100}=199.96 \mathrm{amu} \approx 200 \mathrm{amu}\)
9. (a) : Average atomic mass \(=\frac{19 \times 10+81 \times 11}{100}=10.81\)
10. (a) : 4 mol of helium \(=4 \times N_{A}\) atoms

4 u of helium = 1 atom
4 g of helium \(=1 \mathrm{~mol}=N_{A}\) atoms
2.271098 L of helium \(=\frac{2.271098}{22.7} \mathrm{~mol}=0.1 \mathrm{~mol}=0.1 N_{A}\) atoms
11. (d) : 1 mole of substance \(=N_{A}\) atoms

108 g of \(\mathrm{Ag}=N_{A}\) atoms \(\Rightarrow 1 \mathrm{~g}\) of \(\mathrm{Ag}=\frac{N_{A}}{108}\) atoms
24 g of \(\mathrm{Mg}=N_{A}\) atoms \(\Rightarrow 1 \mathrm{~g}\) of \(\mathrm{Mg}=\frac{N_{A}}{24}\) atoms
32 g of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}=N_{A}\) molecules \(=2 N_{A}\) atoms
\(\Rightarrow 1 \mathrm{~g}\) of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}=\frac{N_{A}}{16}\) atoms
7 g of \(\mathrm{Li}=N_{A}\) atoms \(\Rightarrow 1 \mathrm{~g}\) of \(\mathrm{Li}=\frac{N_{A}}{7}\) atoms
Therefore, 1 g of \(\mathrm{Li}_{(s)}\), has maximum number of atoms.
12. (a): (a) Mass of water \(=V \times d=18 \times 1=18 \mathrm{~g}\)

Molecules of water \(=\) mole \(\times N_{A}=10^{-4} N_{A}\)
(d) Molecules of water \(=\) mole \(\times N_{A}=10^{-3} N_{A}\)
13. (a) : Let atomic weight of element \(X\) is \(x\) and that of element \(Y\) is \(y\).
For \(X Y_{2}, n=\frac{w}{\text { Mol. } w \mathrm{t} .}\)
\(0.1=\frac{10}{x+2 y} \Rightarrow x+2 y=\frac{10}{0.1}=100\)

For \(X_{3} Y_{2}, n=\frac{w}{\text { Mol. wt. }}\)
\(0.05=\frac{9}{3 x+2 y} \Rightarrow 3 x+2 y=\frac{9}{0.05}=180\)

On solving equations (i) and (ii), we get \(x=40\)
\(40+2 y=100 \Rightarrow 2 y=60 \Rightarrow y=30\)

\[
=6.023 \times 10^{22} \text { molecules }
\]

18 gram of water \(=6.023 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
18 moles of water \(=18 \times 6.023 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
16. (d) : Number of moles of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}=1 / 2\)

Number of moles of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}=\frac{4}{32}\)
Hence, molar ratio \(=\frac{1}{2}: \frac{4}{32}=4: 1\)
17. (c) : \(8 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{H}_{2}\) has 4 moles while the others has 1 mole each.
18. (b) : No. of atoms \(=N_{A} \times\) No. of moles \(\times 3\)
\[
=6.023 \times 10^{23} \times 0.1 \times 3=1.806 \times 10^{23}
\]
19. (a) : At STP, \(22.4 \mathrm{~L}=6.023 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
\(15 \mathrm{~L} \mathrm{H}_{2}=\frac{6.023 \times 10^{23} \times 15}{22.4}=4.033 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
\(5 \mathrm{~L} \mathrm{~N}_{2}=\frac{6.023 \times 10^{23} \times 5}{22.4}=1.344 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
\(2 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{H}_{2}=6.023 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
\(0.5 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{H}_{2}=\frac{6.023 \times 10^{23} \times 0.5}{2}=1.505 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
\(32 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{O}_{2}=6.023 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
10 g of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}=\frac{6.023 \times 10^{23} \times 10}{32}=1.882 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
20. (b) : Number of molecules \(=\) moles \(\times N_{A}\)

Molecules of \(\mathrm{N}_{2}=\frac{7}{14} N_{A}=0.5 N_{A}\), Molecules of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}=N_{A}\)
Molecules of \(\mathrm{NO}_{2}=\frac{16}{46} N_{A}=0.35 N_{A}\)

Molecules of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}=\frac{16}{32} N_{A}=0.5 N_{A}\)
\(\therefore \quad 2 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{H}_{2}\) (1 mole \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\) ) contains maximum molecules.
21. (a) : Specific volume (vol. of 1 g ) of cylindrical virus particle \(=6.02 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{cc} / \mathrm{g}\)
Radius of virus, \(r=7 \AA=7 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~cm}\)
Volume of virus \(=\pi r^{2} l\)
\(=\frac{22}{7} \times\left(7 \times 10^{-8}\right)^{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-8}=154 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{cc}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
\text { wt. of one virus particle }= & \frac{\text { Volume }(\mathrm{cc})}{\text { Specific volume }(\mathrm{cc} / \mathrm{g})} \\
& =\frac{154 \times 10^{-23}}{6.02 \times 10^{-2}} \mathrm{~g}
\end{aligned}
\]
\(\therefore \quad\) Molecular wt. of virus \(=\mathrm{wt}\). of \(N_{A}\) particles
\[
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{154 \times 10^{-23}}{6.02 \times 10^{-2}} \times 6.02 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \\
& =15400 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}=15.4 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{mol}

23. (a) : Quantity of iron in one molecule
\[
=\frac{67200}{100} \times 0.334=224.45 \mathrm{amu}
\]

24. (a) : Volume of oxygen in one litre of air
\[
=\frac{21}{100} \times 1000=210 \mathrm{~mL}
\]

Therefore, no. of moles \(=\frac{210}{22400}=0.0093 \mathrm{~mol}\)
25. (c) : Each nitrogen atom has 5 valence electrons, therefore total number of valence electrons in \(\mathrm{N}_{3}^{-}\)ion is 16 . Since the molecular mass of \(\mathrm{N}_{3}^{-}\)is 42 , therefore total number of valence electrons in 4.2 g of \(\mathrm{N}_{3}^{-}\)ion \(=\frac{4.2}{42} \times 16 \times N_{A}=1.6 N_{A}\)
26. (b) : Avogadro's no., \(N_{A}=6.02 \times 10^{23}\) molecules \(=1\) mole

22.4 L at NTP \(=6.02 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
\(\therefore \quad 11.2 \mathrm{~L}\) at NTP \(=3.01 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
Since gas is diatomic,
\(\therefore \quad 11.2 \mathrm{~L}\) at NTP \(=2 \times 3.01 \times 10^{23}\) atoms \(=6.02 \times 10^{23}\) atoms
28. (a) : \(1 \mathrm{~mol}^{\circ}\) of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}=44 \mathrm{~g}\) of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\)

[Since, 1 mole \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}=6 \times 10^{23}\) molecules]
\(=2 \times 6 \times 10^{22}\) atoms of \(\mathrm{O}=1.2 \times 10^{23}\) atoms of O
29. (d) : As we know,

22400 cc of \(\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) contain \(6.02 \times 10^{23}\) molecules
\(\therefore \quad 1 \mathrm{cc}\) of \(\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) contain \(\frac{6.02 \times 10^{23}}{22400}\) molecules
Since in \(\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) molecule there are 3 atoms.
\(\therefore \quad 1 \mathrm{cc} \mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}=\frac{3 \times 6.02 \times 10^{23}}{22400}\) atoms \(=\frac{1.8 \times 10^{22}}{224}\) atoms

No. of electrons in a molecule of \(\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}=7+7+8=22\) Hence, no. of electrons in 1 cc of \(\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
\(=\frac{6.02 \times 10^{23}}{22400} \times 22\) electrons \(=\frac{1.32}{224} \times 10^{23}\) electrons

\hline Hydrogen & 22 & \(\frac{22}{1}=22\) & \(\frac{22}{6.5}=3.3 \approx 3\) \\

∴ Empirical formula \(=\mathrm{CH}_{3}\)
32. (c) :

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Element & \% & Atomic mass & Mole & Simplest ratio \\
\hline C & 38.71 & 12 & \(\frac{38.71}{12}=3.22\) & \(\frac{3.22}{3.22}=1\) \\
\hline H & 9.67 & 1 & \(\frac{9.67}{1}=9.67\) & \(\frac{9.67}{3.22}=3\) \\
\hline O & 51.62 & 16 & \(\frac{51.62}{16}=3.22\) & \(\frac{3.22}{3.22}=1\) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Hence, empirical formula of the compound would be \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{O}\).
33. (a) : In peroxidase anhydrous enzyme, \(0.5 \%\) Se is present means, 0.5 g Se is present in 100 g of enzyme. In a molecule of enzyme one Se atom must be present. Hence, 78.4 g Se will be present in \(\frac{100}{0.5} \times 78.4=1.568 \times 10^{4}\)
∴ \(\quad\) Minimum molecular weight of enzyme is \(1.568 \times 10^{4}\).
34. (c): Urea \(\left(\mathrm{NH}_{2} \mathrm{CONH}_{2}\right), \%\) of \(\mathrm{N}=\frac{28}{60} \times 100=46.66 \%\)

Similarly, \% of N in other compounds are :
\(\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}=21.2 \% ; \mathrm{CaCN}_{2}=35.0 \%\) and \(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{NO}_{3}=35.0 \%\)
35. (b) : Molarity \(=\frac{\text { Moles }}{\text { Volume }(\mathrm{mL})} \times 1000\)
For HCl ,

No. of moles \(=\frac{M \times V(\mathrm{~mL})}{1000}=\frac{0.75 \times 25}{1000}=\frac{0.75}{40}\)
Mass of HCl reacted \(=\frac{0.75}{40} \times 36.5=0.684 \mathrm{~g}\)
According to balanced equation
\[
\underset{\substack{\mathrm{NaOH} \\ 1 \mathrm{~mole} \\(40 \mathrm{~g}) \quad+\underset{1 \mathrm{~mole}}{\mathrm{HCl}} \rightarrow \mathrm{NaCl}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \\(36.5 \mathrm{~g})}}{ }
\]
36.5 g HCl reacts with 40 g NaOH
0.684 g HCl will react with \(\frac{40}{36.5} \times 0.684=0.75 \mathrm{~g}\)

NaOH left unreacted \(=1-0.75=0.25 \mathrm{~g}\) or 250 mg
36. \(\underset{40+12+16 \times 3=100 \mathrm{~g}}{(\mathrm{~d}): \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}} \xrightarrow[40+16=56 \mathrm{~g}]{1200 \mathrm{~K}}+\underset{44 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\)
\(100 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\) produced \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) gas \(=44 \mathrm{~g}\)
\(20 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\) will produce \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) gas \(=\frac{44}{100} \times 20=8.8 \mathrm{~g}\)
If sample is 100\% pure, \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) produced \(=8.8 \mathrm{~g}\)
If sample is \(20 \%\) pure, \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) produced \(=\frac{8.8}{100} \times 20=1.76 \mathrm{~g}\)
37. (b) : Volume of \(\mathrm{HCl}=50 \mathrm{~mL}=0.05 \mathrm{~L}\)

Molarity of \(\mathrm{HCl}=0.5 \mathrm{M}\)
\(\therefore \quad\) Moles of \(\mathrm{HCl}=0.05 \times 0.5=0.025\) moles
\(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}+2 \mathrm{HCl} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
For 2 moles of \(\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\) required \(=1\) mole
\(\therefore \quad\) For 0.025 moles of \(\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\) required \(=\frac{0.025}{2}\) moles Mass of \(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\) required \(=100 \times \frac{0.025}{2}=1.25 \mathrm{~g}\)
For \(95 \%\) pure \(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\), mass of \(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\) required \(=\frac{1.25}{95} \times 100 \mathrm{~g} =1.315 \mathrm{~g} \approx 1.32 \mathrm{~g}\)
38. (d) : Haber's process, \(\mathrm{N}_{2}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}\)

2 moles of \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\) are formed by 3 moles of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\).
\(\therefore \quad 20\) moles of \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\) will be formed by 30 moles of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\).
39. (c) : Density \(=1.28 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cc}\), Conc. of solution \(=2 \mathrm{M}\)

Molar mass of \(\mathrm{NaOH}=40 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
Volume of solution \(=1 \mathrm{~L}=1000 \mathrm{~mL}\)
Mass of solution \(=d \times V=1.28 \times 1000=1280 \mathrm{~g}\)
Mass of solute \(=n \times\) Molar mass \(=2 \times 40=80 \mathrm{~g}\)
Mass of solvent \(=(1280-80) \mathrm{g}=1200 \mathrm{~g}\)
\(\therefore \quad\) Molality \(=\frac{2 \times 1000}{1200}=1.67 \mathrm{~m}\)
40. (c) : \(\mathrm{HCOOH} \xrightarrow[\text { conc. } \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}]{\text { Dehydrating agent }} \mathrm{CO}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
n_{i}=\frac{2.3}{46}=\frac{1}{20} & 0 \\
n_{f}=0 & \frac{1}{20}
\end{aligned}
\]
\(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4} \xrightarrow{\text { conc. } \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}} \mathrm{CO}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
\(n_{i}=\frac{4.5}{90}=\frac{1}{20}\)
000
\(n_{f}=0\)
\(\frac{1}{20} \quad \frac{1}{20} \quad \frac{1}{20}\)
\(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) gets absorbed by conc. \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\). Gaseous mixture (containing CO and \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) ) when passed through KOH pellets, \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) gets absorbed.
Moles of CO left (unabsorbed) \(=\frac{1}{20}+\frac{1}{20}=\frac{1}{10}\)
Mass of CO \(=\) moles × molar mass \(=\frac{1}{10} \times 28=2.8 \mathrm{~g}\)
41. (b) : \(16.9 \%\) solution of \(\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}\) means 16.9 g of \(\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}\) in 100 mL of solution.
\(=8.45 \mathrm{~g}\) of \(\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}\) in 50 mL solution.

Similarly, 5.8 g of NaCl in 100 mL solution
\(\equiv 2.9 \mathrm{~g}\) of NaCl in 50 mL solution .
The reaction can be represented as :

\begin{tabular}{lcccc} 
& \(\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}+\mathrm{NaCl} \longrightarrow \mathrm{AgCl} \downarrow+\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}\) \\
Initial & \(8.45 / 170\) & \(2.9 / 58.5\) & 0 & 0 \\
mole & \(=0.049\) & \(=0.049\) & & \\
Final moles & 0 & 0 & 0.049 & 0.049
\end{tabular}
∴ \(\quad\) Mass of AgCl precipitated \(=0.049 \times 143.3=7.02 \approx 7 \mathrm{~g}\)
42. (c) : \(\mathrm{MgCO}_{3(s)} \xrightarrow{\Delta} \mathrm{MgO}_{(s)}+\mathrm{CO}_{2(g)}\)
\[
84 \mathrm{~g} \quad 40 \mathrm{~g}
\]

84 g of \(\mathrm{MgCO}_{3} \equiv 40 \mathrm{~g}\) of MgO
\(\therefore \quad 20 \mathrm{~g}\) of \(\mathrm{MgCO}_{3} \equiv \frac{40}{84} \times 20=9.52 \mathrm{~g}\) of MgO
Actual yield \(=8 \mathrm{~g}\) of MgO
\(\therefore \quad \%\) purity \(=\frac{8}{9.52} \times 100=84 \%\)
43. (a) : 1 mole \(\equiv 22.4\) litres at STP.
\(n_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}=\frac{22.4}{22.4}=1 \mathrm{~mol} ; n_{\mathrm{Cl}_{2}}=\frac{11.2}{22.4}=0.5 \mathrm{~mol}\)
Reaction is as,

\begin{tabular}{lccc} 
& \(\mathrm{H}_{2(g)}+\) & \(\underset{2(g)}{\mathrm{Cl}_{2(g)}} \longrightarrow \underset{0}{2 \mathrm{HCl}_{(g)}}\) \\
Initial & 1 mol & 0.5 mol & \\
Final & \((1-0.5)\) & \((0.5-0.5)\) & \\
& \(=0.5 \mathrm{~mol}\) & \(=0 \mathrm{~mol}\) & \\
& \(=0.5\) \\
& \(=0 \mathrm{~mol}\)
\end{tabular}

Here, \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\) is limiting reagent. So, 1 mole of \(\mathrm{HCl}_{(g)}\) is formed.
44. (a): \(n_{\mathrm{Mg}}=\frac{1}{24}=0.0416 \mathrm{~mol}\)
\(n_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\frac{0.56}{32}=0.0175 \mathrm{~mol}\)
The balanced equation is

\begin{tabular}{lccc} 
& \(2 \mathrm{Mg}+\) & \(\mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow\) & 2 MgO \\
Initial & 0.0416 mol & 0.0175 mol & 0 \\
Final & \((0.0416-2 \times 0.0175)\) & 0 & \(2 \times 0.0175\)
\end{tabular}
\[
=0.0066 \mathrm{~mol}
\]

Here, \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) is limiting reagent.
∴ Mass of Mg left in excess \(=0.0066 \times 24=0.16 \mathrm{~g}\)
45. (d) : Moles of urea \(=\frac{6.02 \times 10^{20}}{6.02 \times 10^{23}}=0.001\)

Concentration of solution \(=\frac{0.001}{100} \times 1000=0.01 \mathrm{M}\)
46. (b) : Millimoles of solution of chloride \(=0.05 \times 10=0.5\) Millimoles of \(\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}\) solution \(=10 \times 0.1=1\)
So, the millimoles of \(\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}\) are double than the chloride solution.
\(\therefore \quad \mathrm{XCl}_{2}+2 \mathrm{AgNO}_{3} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{AgCl}+\mathrm{X}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2}\)
47. (b) : Given that molar mass of \(\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=106 \mathrm{~g}\)
\(\therefore \quad\) Molarity of solution \(=\frac{25.3 \times 1000}{106 \times 250}=0.955 \mathrm{M}\)
\(\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}\)
\(\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]=2\left[\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]=2 \times 0.955=1.910 \mathrm{M}\)
\(\left[\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}\right]=\left[\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]=0.955 \mathrm{M}\)
48. (b) : \(\mathrm{H}_{2}+1 / 2 \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
2 \mathrm{~g} & 16 \mathrm{~g} & 18 \mathrm{~g} \\
1 \mathrm{~mol} & 0.5 \mathrm{~mol} & 1 \mathrm{~mol}
\end{array}
\]

10 g of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}=5 \mathrm{~mol}\) and 64 g of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}=2 \mathrm{~mol}\)
∴ In this reaction, oxygen is the limiting reagent so amount of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) produced depends on the amount of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\).
Since 0.5 mol of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) gives 1 mol of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
\(\therefore \quad 2 \mathrm{~mol}\) of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) will give 4 mol of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
49. (b) : \(\mathrm{PbO}+2 \mathrm{HCl} \rightarrow \mathrm{PbCl}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{6.5}{224} \mathrm{~mol} \quad \frac{3.2}{36.5} \mathrm{~mol} \\
& =0.029 \mathrm{~mol} \quad=0.087 \mathrm{~mol}
\end{aligned}
\]

Formation of moles of lead(II) chloride depends upon the no. of moles of PbO which acts as a limiting reagent here. So, no. of moles of \(\mathrm{PbCl}_{2}\) formed will be equal to the no. of moles of PbO i.e., 0.029.
50. (c) : \(3 \mathrm{C}+2 \mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \longrightarrow 4 \mathrm{Al}+3 \mathrm{CO}_{2}\)
(From bauxite)
4 moles of Al is produced by 3 moles of C .
1 mole of Al is produced by \(\frac{3}{4}\) mole of C .
\(\frac{270 \times 1000}{27}=10^{4}\) moles of Al is produced by \(\frac{3}{4} \times 10^{4}\) moles of C .
\[
\begin{aligned}
\text { Amount of carbon used } & =\frac{3}{4} \times 10^{4} \times 12 \mathrm{~g} \\
& =\frac{3}{4} \times 10 \times 12 \mathrm{~kg}=90 \mathrm{~kg}
\end{aligned}
\]
51. (c) : Density \(=1.17 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cc}\).
\(\Rightarrow \quad 1 \mathrm{cc}\). solution contains 1.17 g of HCl
\(\therefore \quad\) Molarity \(=\frac{1.17 \times 1000}{36.5 \times 1}=32.05 \mathrm{M}\)
52. (b) : \(\mathrm{BaCO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{BaO}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}\)
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
197.3 \mathrm{~g} & 22.4 \mathrm{~L} \text { at N.T.P. } \\
9.85 \mathrm{~g} & \begin{aligned}
\frac{22.4}{197.3} & \times 9.85 \\
& =1.118 \mathrm{~L}
\end{aligned}
\end{array}
\]
\(\Rightarrow \quad 9.85 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{BaCO}_{3}\) will produce 1.118 L of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) at N.T.P. on the complete decomposition:
53. (a) : \(4 \mathrm{NH}_{3(g)}+5 \mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 4 \mathrm{NO}_{(g)}+6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)}\)

4 moles 5 moles 4 moles 6 moles
\(\Rightarrow 1\) mole of \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\) requires \(=5 / 4=1.25\) mole of oxygen while 1 mole of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) requires \(=4 / 5=0.8\) mole of \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\).
Therefore, all oxygen will be consumed.
54. (c) : \(\mathrm{Zn}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \rightarrow \mathrm{ZnSO}_{4}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\)

65 g 22400 mL
Since 65 g of zinc reacts to liberate 22400 mL of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\) at STP, therefore amount of zinc needed to produce 224 mL of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\) at STP \(=\frac{65}{22400} \times 224=0.65 \mathrm{~g}\)
55. (a) : Weight of \(1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{of}^{\mathrm{CCl}_{4}}\) vapour
\[
=12+4 \times 35.5=154 \mathrm{~g}
\]
∴ \(\quad\) Density of \(\mathrm{CCl}_{4}\) vapour \(=\frac{154}{22.4} \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}=6.875 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}\)

or \(\frac{25}{50}=\frac{\lambda_{2}}{\lambda_{1}}\) or \(\frac{1}{2}=\frac{\lambda_{2}}{\lambda_{1}} \Rightarrow \lambda_{1}=2 \lambda_{2}\)
14. (c) : Applying \(\cup=c / \lambda\),
\(\lambda=\frac{c}{v}=\frac{3 \times 10^{8}}{8 \times 10^{15}}=37.5 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}=37.5 \mathrm{~nm} \approx 4 \times 10^{1} \mathrm{~nm}\)
15. (d) : \(E=\frac{h c}{\lambda} \Rightarrow \lambda=\frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^{8}}{3.03 \times 10^{-19}}=656 \mathrm{~nm}\)

For ground state \(\mathrm{He}^{+}\)ion, \(Z=2, n=1\)
\[
E_{1}=-R_{\mathrm{H}} \frac{2^{2}}{1^{2}}=-4 R_{\mathrm{H}}=-x \mathrm{~J}

For \(\mathrm{He}^{+}, n=2 ; Z=2\)
\(r_{\mathrm{He}^{+}}=r_{0} \times \frac{2 \times 2}{2} ; 105.8=r_{0} \times 2\)
\(r_{0}=\frac{105.8}{2} \mathrm{pm}\)
For \(\mathrm{Li}^{2+} ; n=3 ; Z=3\)
\(r_{\mathrm{Li}^{2+}}=r_{0} \times \frac{(3)^{2}}{3}=\frac{105.8}{2} \times 3=158.7 \mathrm{pm}\) or \(1.587 \AA\)
19. (b) : The electron is more tightly bound in the smallest allowed orbit.
20. (c) : We know that
\[
\Delta E \propto\left[\frac{1}{n_{1}^{2}}-\frac{1}{n_{2}^{2}}\right], \text { where } n_{2}>n_{1}
\]
\(\therefore \quad n=6\) to \(n=5\) will give least energetic photon.
21. (b) : \(E_{n}=-K\left(\frac{Z}{n}\right)^{2}\)
\(Z=1\) for hydrogen; \(n=2\)
\(E_{2}=\frac{-K \times 1}{4} \Rightarrow E_{2}=-328 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} ; K=4 \times 328\)
\(E_{4}=\frac{-K \times 1}{16} \Rightarrow E_{4}=-4 \times 328 \times \frac{1}{16}=-82 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
22. (c) : \(E=h v\) or \(v=E / h\)

For H atom, \(E=\frac{-21.8 \times 10^{-19}}{n^{2}} \mathrm{~J}_{\text {atom }}{ }^{-1}\)
\(\Delta E=-21.8 \times 10^{-19}\left(\frac{1}{4^{2}}-\frac{1}{1^{2}}\right)=20.44 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{atom}^{-1}\)
\(v=\frac{20.44 \times 10^{-19}}{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}=3.08 \times 10^{15} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\)
23. (a) : Kinetic energy \(=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=\left(\frac{\pi e^{2}}{n h}\right)^{2} \times 2 m\)
\[
\left[\because v=\frac{2 \pi e^{2}}{n h}\right]
\]

Total energy, \(E_{n}=-\frac{2 \pi^{2} m e^{4}}{n^{2} h^{2}}=-\left(\frac{\pi e^{2}}{n h}\right)^{2} \times 2 m=-K . E\).
\(\therefore \quad\) Kinetic energy \(=-E_{n}\)
Energy of first excited state is -3.4 eV .
\(\therefore \quad\) Kinetic energy of same orbit ( \(n=2\) ) will be +3.4 eV .
24. (d) : Sommerfeld modified Bohr's theory considering that in addition to circular orbits electrons also move in elliptical orbits.
25. (d) : For \(n^{\text {th }}\) orbit of ' \(H\) ' atom, \(r_{n}=n^{2} \times r_{1}\)

\]
26. (d) : Energy of an atom when \(n=1\)
\(E_{1}=-\frac{1312}{(1)^{2}}=-1312 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
Similarly energy when \(n=3,\left(E_{3}\right)=-\frac{1312}{(3)^{2}}=-145.7 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)

The energy absorbed when an electron jumps from \(n=1\) to \(n=3\), \(E_{3}-E_{1}=-145.7-(-1312)=1166.3 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
\[
=\frac{1166.3}{6.023 \times 10^{23}}=193.6 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~kJ}
\]
\(=193.6 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{~J}\)
[ 1 joule \(=10^{7}\) ergs ]

Now, radius of \(\mathrm{Li}^{2+}\) ion \(=r \times \frac{n^{2}}{Z}=0.53 \times \frac{(1)^{2}}{3}=0.17 \AA\)
28. (c) : Energy of an electron in \(n^{\text {th }}\) Bohr orbit of hydrogen atom \(=\frac{-13.6}{n^{2}} \mathrm{eV}\).
29. (b) : Both He and \(\mathrm{Li}^{+}\)contain 2 electrons each.
30. (a) : Radius of \(n^{\text {th }}\) orbit of H -atom \(=r_{0} n^{2}\)
where \(r_{0}=\) radius of the first orbit.
31. (b) : Bohr radius, \(a_{0}=52.9 \mathrm{pm}\)
\(n=2, r_{n}=n^{2} a_{0}=(2)^{2} a_{0}=4 \times 52.9 \mathrm{pm}=211.6 \mathrm{pm}\)
The angular momentum of an electron in a given stationary state can be expressed as in equation,
\[
m v r=n \cdot \frac{h}{2 \pi}=2 \times \frac{h}{2 \pi}=\frac{h}{\pi} \Rightarrow m v r \pi=h
\]
de-Broglie equation,
\[
\lambda=\frac{h}{m v} ; \lambda m v=h
\]

From equations (i) and (ii), we get \(\lambda=\pi r\)
Putting the value of \(r, \lambda=211.6 \pi \mathrm{pm}\)
32. (c) : According to de-Broglie equation, \(\lambda=\frac{h}{m v}\)

Given, \(h=6.6 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~s} ; m=0.66 \mathrm{~kg} ; v=100 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\)
\(\therefore \lambda=\frac{6.6 \times 10^{-34}}{0.66 \times 100}=1 \times 10^{-35} \mathrm{~m}\)
33. (c) : From Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
\(\Delta p \cdot \Delta x \geq \frac{h}{4 \pi}\) or \(m \Delta v \times \Delta x \geq \frac{h}{4 \pi}\)
or \((m \Delta v)^{2} \geq \frac{h}{4 \pi} \quad(\because \Delta x=\Delta p)\) or \(\Delta v \geq \frac{1}{2 m} \sqrt{\frac{h}{\pi}}\)
34. (c) : Uncertainty in momentum ( \(m \Delta v\) )
\[
=1 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\]

Uncertainty in velocity \((\Delta v)=\frac{1 \times 10^{-18}}{9 \times 10^{-28}}=1.1 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\)
35. (b) : \(\Delta x \cdot m \Delta v=h / 4 \pi\)
\(0.1 \times 10^{-10} \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times \Delta v=\frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4 \times 3.143}\)
\(\therefore \quad \Delta v=\frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{0.1 \times 10^{-10} \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times 4 \times 3.143}\)
\[
=5.79 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\]
36. (a) : \(\Delta x \times \Delta p=\frac{h}{4 \pi}\) (Heisenberg uncertainty principle)
\(\Rightarrow \Delta x=\frac{6.62 \times 10^{-34}}{4 \times 3.14 \times 10^{-5}}=5.27 \times 10^{-30} \mathrm{~m}\)
37. (c) : \(\lambda=\frac{h}{m v}=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{erg} \mathrm{sec}}{1 \mathrm{~g} \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}}\)
\[
=6.63 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~cm}=6.63 \times 10^{-33} \mathrm{~m}
\]
38. (d) : According to uncertainty principle the product of uncertainty in position and uncertainty in momentum is constant for a particle.
i.e., \(\Delta x \times \Delta p=\frac{h}{4 \pi}\)
As, \(\Delta x=1.0 \mathrm{~nm}\) for both electron and helium atom, so \(\Delta p\) is also same for both the particles.
Thus, uncertainty in momentum of the helium atom is also \(5.0 \times 10^{-26} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\).
39. (c): Mass of an electron \((m)=9.1 \times 10^{-28} \mathrm{~g}\)

Velocity of electron \((v)=3 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}\)
Accuracy \(=0.001 \%=\frac{0.001}{100}\) and
Planck's constant \((h)=6.626 \times 10^{-27}\) erg-second.
We know that actual velocity of the electron
\((\Delta v)=3 \times 10^{4} \times \frac{0.001}{100}=0.3 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}\)
Therefore, uncertainty in the position of the electron,
\((\Delta x)=\frac{h}{4 \pi m \Delta v}=\frac{6.626 \times 10^{-27}}{4 \pi \times\left(9.1 \times 10^{-28}\right) \times 0.3}=1.93 \mathrm{~cm}\)
40. (d) : It is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and not Bohr's postulate.
41. (b) : Principal quantum no. (n) determines the size of orbital. Azimuthal quantum no. (l) gives idea of shape of orbitals. Magnetic quantum no. ( \(m_{l}\) ) gives information about the spatial orientation of orbitals while spin quantum no. ( \(m_{\mathrm{s}}\) ) gives information about the direction of spin of the electron present in any orbital.
42. (b) : For a given value of \(l, m_{l}\) has ( \(2 l+1\) ) values. For \(l=2\), the number of \(m_{l}\) values is \([2(2)+1]=5\). But in set (b), only four values of \(m_{l}\) are given. The values of \(m_{l}\) range from \(-l\) to \(+l\) including 0 .
Hence, the possible \(m_{l}\) values for the given orbital are \(-2,-1\), \(0,+1,+2\).
43. (a) : The square of the wave function \(\left(\psi^{2}\right)\) at a point gives the probability density of the electron at that point.
44. (c) : \(n_{m}=2 l+1\) or \(l=\frac{n_{m}-1}{2}\)
45. (d) : The shapes of \(d_{x y}, d_{x z}, d_{y z}\) and \(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\) are similar to each other, whereas that of \(d_{z^{2}}\) is different from others. All five \(3 d\) orbitals are equivalent in energy. The \(d\)-orbitals for which \(n\) is greater than \(3(4 d, 5 d, \ldots)\) also have shapes similar to \(3 d\)-orbital but differ in energy and size.
46. (b) : Higher the value of ( \(n+l\) ) for an orbital, higher is its energy. However, if two different types of orbitals have same value of ( \(n+l\) ), the orbital with lower value of \(n\) has lower energy. Therefore, decreasing order of energy of the given orbitals is \(5 f>6 p>5 p>4 d\).
47. (c) : Number of spherical/radial nodes in any orbital \(=n-l-1\)
Number of planar/angular nodes in orbital \(=l=3\)
\(\therefore \quad\) Total number of nodes in any orbital \(=n-1=3\)
\(\therefore \quad n=4\)
Thus, the orbital is \(4 f\).
48. (c) : According to Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity, the correct configuration of ' N ' is

49. (c) : In case of hydrogen like atoms, energy depends on the principal quantum number only. Hence, \(2 s\)-orbital will have energy equal to \(2 p\)-orbital.
50. (a) : For \(n=3\) and \(l=1\), the subshell is \(3 p\) and a particular \(3 p\) orbital can accommodate only 2 electrons.
51. (c) : \(d_{x^{2}}{ }^{2}-y^{2}\) and \(d_{z}{ }^{2}\) orbitals have electron density along the axes while \(d_{x y}, d_{y z}\) and \(d_{x z}\) orbitals have electron density in between the axes.
52. (b) : For the two electrons occupying the same orbital values of \(n, l\) and \(m_{l}\) are same but \(m_{s}\) is different, i.e., \(+\frac{1}{2}\) and \(-\frac{1}{2}\).
53. (c) : \(\operatorname{Ti}(22): 1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 4 s^{2} 3 d^{2}\)
\(\therefore \quad\) Order of increasing energy is \(3 s, 3 p, 4 s, 3 d\).
54. (d) : Number of \(d\)-electrons in \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}=6\)

Number of \(p\)-electrons in \(\mathrm{Cl}=11\)

56. (a) : Only one orbital, \(3 p_{z}\) has following set of quantum numbers, \(n=3, l=1\) and \(m_{l}=0\).
57. (b) : The orbital associated with \(n=3, l=1\) is \(3 p\). One orbital (with \(m=-1\) ) of \(3 p\)-subshell can accommodate maximum 2 electrons.
58. (b) : The electronic configuration of \({ }_{64} \mathrm{Gd}\) is \([\mathrm{Xe}] 4 f^{7} 5 d^{1} 6 s^{2}\).

60. (c) \(: \operatorname{Rb}(37): 1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 4 s^{2} 3 d^{10} 4 p^{6} 5 s^{1}\)

For \(5 s, n=5, l=0, m=0, s=+1 / 2\) or \(-1 / 2\)
61. (a) : Orbital angular momentum ( \(m\) )
\(=\sqrt{l(l+1)} \frac{h}{2 \pi}\)
For \(p\)-electrons; \(l=1\)
Thus, \(m=\sqrt{1(1+1)} \frac{h}{2 \pi}=\frac{\sqrt{2} h}{2 \pi}=\frac{h}{\sqrt{2} \pi}\)
62. (b) : Total number of atomic orbitals in any energy level is given by \(n^{2}\).
63. (a)
64. (d) : For a given shell, \(n\), the number of subshells \(=(2 l+1)\)
Since each orbitals can accommodate 2 electrons of opposite spin, so maximum number of electrons in a subshell \(=2(2 l+1) =4 l+2\).

In option (b), \(l=2\) and \(m_{l}=-3\)
This is not possible, as values of \(m_{l}\) which are possible for \(l=2\) are \(-2,-1,0,+1\) and +2 only.
66. (b) : (i) represents an electron in \(3 s\) orbital.
(ii) is not possible as value of \(l\) varies from \(0,1, \ldots(n-1)\).

67. (d) : Principal quantum number represents the name, size and energy of the shell to which the electron belongs. Azimuthal quantum number describes the spatial distribution of electron cloud and angular momentum. Magnetic quantum number describes the orientation or distribution of electron cloud. Spin quantum number represents the direction of electron spin around its own axis.

71. (d) : This is Pauli's exclusion principle.
72. (d) : \(l=3\) means \(f\)-subshell

Maximum no. of electrons in \(f\)-subshell \(=14\)
\(f\)-subshell \(=\)\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}

\hline
\end{tabular}
73. (b) : Higher the value of \((n+l)\) for an orbital, higher is its energy. However, if two different types of orbitals have same value of ( \(n+l\) ), the orbital with lower value of \(n\) has lower energy.

17. The formation of the oxide ion, \(\mathrm{O}_{(g)}^{2-}\) from oxygen atom requires first an exothermic and then an endothermic step as shown below :
\(\mathrm{O}_{(g)}+e^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{O}_{(g)}^{-} ; \Delta_{f} H^{\circ}=-141 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
\(\mathrm{O}_{(g)}^{-}+e^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{O}_{(g)}^{2-} ; \Delta_{f} H^{\circ}=+780 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
Thus, process of formation of \(\mathrm{O}^{2-}\) in gas phase is unfavourable even though \(\mathrm{O}^{2-}\) is isoelectronic with neon. It is due to the fact that,
(a) \(\mathrm{O}^{-}\)ion has comparatively smaller size than oxygen atom

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (a) : The IUPAC name of an element with atomic number 119 is ununennium.
2. (d) : Unnilunium - Mendelevium ⇒ (a)-(i)

Unniltrium - Lawrencium ⇒ (b)-(ii)
Unnilhexium - Seaborgium ⇒ (c)-(iii)
Unununnium - Roentgenium ⇒ (d) ⊛ (iv)
3. (a) : The electronic configuration of the element with \(Z=114\) (Flerovium) is \([R n] 5 f^{14} 6 d^{10} 7 s^{2} 7 p^{2}\).
Hence, it belongs to carbon family which has the same outer electronic configuration.
4. (a) : The electronic configuration of an atom:
\[
1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 3 d^{3} 4 s^{2}
\]

In the configuration, the last electron of the atom is filled in \(d\)-subshell as \(3 d^{3}\). Thus, this element belongs to \(d\)-block of the periodic table with group no. VB or 5 .
5. (c) : Atomic number of the given element is 15 and it belongs to group 15. Therefore atomic number of the element below the above element \(=15+18=33\).
6. (c) : Electronic configuration of an element with \(Z=33\) is \(1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 3 d^{10} 4 s^{2} 4 p^{3}\).
Hence, it lies in VA or \(15{ }^{\text {th }}\) group.
7. (c) : Elements (a), (b) and (d) belong to the same group since each one of them has two electrons in valence shell. In contrast, element (c) has seven electrons in the valence shell, and hence it lies in other group.
8. (a) : The electronegativity value of elements increases along a period from left to right and decreases down a group. This is because as we move along the period from left to right nuclear charge increases and atomic radius decreases whereas, when we move down the group atomic radius as well as screening effect increases. Thus the order of electronegativity is
\[
\mathrm{Si}<\mathrm{C}<\mathrm{N}<\mathrm{O}<\mathrm{F}
\]
9. (b) : Ionization enthalpy increases left to right in a period but \(\mathrm{Be}\left(1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}\right)\) has higher I.E. than B due to fully filled orbitals. Hence, the correct order is
\[
\mathrm{Li}<\mathrm{B}<\mathrm{Be}<\mathrm{C}<\mathrm{N}
\]
10. (b) : Li and Be forms predominantly covalent compounds due to small size and high charge density. The similarity in properties between lithium and magnesium arises due to diagonal relationship.
11. (d) : Total number of electrons are same in all the species as follows :
\(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Ar}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-} \rightarrow 18\) electrons
12. (a) : \(\mathrm{N}^{3-}, \mathrm{O}^{2-}, \mathrm{F}^{-}\)and \(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\)have 10 electrons each, hence these are isoelectronic. For isoelectronic species, the size of the species decreases as the nuclear charge increases. Hence, the size decreases as \(\mathrm{N}^{3-}>\mathrm{O}^{2-}>\mathrm{F}^{-}>\mathrm{Na}^{+}\).
Hence, among the given elements, nitrogen is expected to form largest ion to achieve the nearest noble gas configuration.
13. (c) : As we move across a period, ionisation enthalpy increases, because of increased nuclear charge and decrease
in atomic radii. However, abnormal values are observed for \(\mathrm{Be}, \mathrm{N}\) and Ne due to extra stability of half filled and fully filled orbitals. Thus, the actual order is,
\(\mathrm{Li}<\mathrm{B}<\mathrm{Be}<\mathrm{C}<\mathrm{O}<\mathrm{N}<\mathrm{F}<\mathrm{Ne}\).
14. (d) : \(\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) - Basic oxide, \(\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\) - Amphoteric oxide, \(\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) - Neutral oxide, \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}\) - Acidic oxide.
15. (b) : In metals, on moving down the group, metallic character increases, so basic nature increases hence most acidic will be BeO .
16. (a, d) : The correct order of increasing negative electron gain enthalpy is: \(\mathrm{I}<\mathrm{Br}<\mathrm{F}<\mathrm{Cl}\) due to electron-electron repulsion in small sized F atom and the correct order of increasing first ionisation enthalpy is \(\mathrm{B}<\mathrm{C}<\mathrm{O}<\mathrm{N}\) due to extra stability of half-filled orbitals in N -atom.
17. (d)
18. (None) : Cations lose electrons and are smaller in size than the parent atom, whereas anions add electrons and are larger in size than the parent atom. Hence, the order is \(\mathrm{H}^{-}>\mathrm{H}>\mathrm{H}^{+}\).
For isoelectronic species, the ionic radii decreases with increase in atomic number i.e., nuclear charge. Hence, the correct orders are
\(\mathrm{O}^{2-}>\mathrm{F}^{-}>\mathrm{Na}^{+}\)and \(\mathrm{N}^{3-}>\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}>\mathrm{Al}^{3+}\).
19. (d) : Electron gain enthalpy becomes less negative from top to bottom in a group while it becomes more negative from left to right within a period.
20. (b) : Acidic strength of hydrides increase with increase in molecular mass.
Thus, order of acidic strength is
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{HF}<\mathrm{HCl}<\mathrm{HBr}<\mathrm{HI} \\
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}<\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}<\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Se}<\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Te} \\
& \mathrm{NH}_{3}<\mathrm{PH}_{3}<\mathrm{AsH}_{3}<\mathrm{SbH}_{3}
\end{aligned}
\]
and as acidic strength increases, \(\mathrm{p} K_{a}\) decreases. Thus order of \(\mathrm{pK} \mathrm{K}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}>\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}>\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Se}>\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Te}\)
21. (a) : As positive charge on the cation increases, effective nuclear charge increases. Thus, atomic size decreases.
22. (a) : \(\mathrm{Na} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}^{+}+e^{-} ; \Delta H=5.1 \mathrm{eV}\)
\(\mathrm{Na}^{+}+e^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na} ; \Delta H=-5.1 \mathrm{eV}\)
23. (a) : \(\mathrm{SnO}_{2}\) reacts with acid as well as base. \(\mathrm{So}, \mathrm{SnO}_{2}\) is an amphoteric oxide.
\(\mathrm{SnO}_{2}+4 \mathrm{HCl} \longrightarrow \mathrm{SnCl}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
\(\mathrm{SnO}_{2}+2 \mathrm{NaOH} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SnO}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
CaO is basic in nature while \(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\) and \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) are acidic in nature.
24. (c) : \(\mathrm{S}^{2-}>\mathrm{Cl}^{-}>\mathrm{K}^{+}>\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\)

Among isoelectronic species, ionic radii increases with increase in negative charge. This happens because effective nuclear charge ( \(Z_{\text {eff }}\) ) decreases.
Similarly, ionic radii decreases with increase in positive charge as \(Z_{\text {eff }}\) increases.
25. (b) : Cl atom has the highest electron affinity in the periodic table. F being a member of group 17 has higher electron gain enthalpy than \(S\) which belongs to group 16. This in turn is higher than the electron affinity of O atom. Thus, \(\mathrm{Cl}>\mathrm{F}>\mathrm{S}>\mathrm{O}\)
It is worth noting that the electron gain enthalpy of oxygen and fluorine, the members of the second period, have less negative
values of electron gain enthalpy than the corresponding elements sulphur and chlorine of the third period.
This is due to small size of the atoms of oxygen and fluorine. As a result, there is a strong inter-electronic repulsion when extra electron is added to these atoms, i.e., electron density is high and the addition of an extra electron is not easy.
26. (b) : The atomic radii decrease on moving from left to right in a period, thus order of sizes for \(\mathrm{Cl}, \mathrm{P}\) and Mg is \(\mathrm{Cl}<\mathrm{P}<\mathrm{Mg}\). Down the group size increases. Thus, overall order is \(\mathrm{Cl}<\mathrm{P}<\mathrm{Mg}<\mathrm{Ca}\).
27. (b) : The cation to anion size ratio will be maximum when the cation is of largest size and the anion is of smallest size. Among the given species, \(\mathrm{Cs}^{+}\)has maximum size among given cations and \(\mathrm{F}^{-}\)has smallest size among given anions, thus CsF has highest \(r_{c} / r_{a}\) ratio.
28. (d) : Among options (a), (c) and (d), option (d) has the highest ionisation energy because of extra stability associated with half-filled \(3 p\)-orbital. In option (b), the presence of \(3 d^{10}\) electrons offers shielding effect, as a result the \(4 p^{3}\) electrons do not experience much nuclear charge and hence, the electrons can be removed easily.
29. (a) : Among isoelectronic ions, ionic radii of anions is more than that of cations. Further size of the anion increases with increase in negative charge and size of the cation decreases with increase in positive charge.
30. (b) : The larger the atomic size, smaller is the value of the ionisation enthalpy. Again higher the screening effect, lesser is the value of ionisation potential. Hence, option (b) has lowest ionisation enthalpy.
31. (a) : In going from left to right across a period in the periodic table, the basicity (i.e., proton affinity) decreases as the electronegativity of the atom possessing the lone pair of electrons increases. Hence, basicity of \(\mathrm{NH}_{2}^{-}\)is higher than \(\mathrm{F}^{-}\). On moving down a group, as the atomic size increases, basicity decreases. Hence, \(\mathrm{F}^{-}\)is more basic than \(\mathrm{I}^{-}\)and \(\mathrm{HO}^{-}\)is more basic than \(\mathrm{HS}^{-}\). Hence, among the given ionic species, \(\mathrm{NH}_{2}^{-}\) has maximum proton affinity.
32. (d) : \(\mathrm{SeO}_{2} \longrightarrow\) acidic oxide,
\(\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}, \mathrm{Sb}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \longrightarrow\) amphoteric, \(\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \longrightarrow\) basic oxide.
33. (a) : \(\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) | Basic character
\(\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}\) decreases down the group
\(\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{Se}\)
\(\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{Te}\) ↓
\(\mathrm{pH} \propto\) basic character
Hence, \(\mathrm{pH}_{1}>\mathrm{pH}_{2}>\mathrm{pH}_{3}>\mathrm{pH}_{4}\)
34. (a)
35. (b) : Amongst isoelectronic ions, ionic radii of anions is more than that of cations. Further size of the anion increases with increase in -ve charge and size of cation decreases with increase in +ve charge. Hence, correct order is \(\mathrm{O}^{2-}>\mathrm{F}^{-}>\mathrm{Na}^{+}>\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}>\mathrm{Al}^{3+}\).
36. (b) : \(\mathrm{Li}, \mathrm{Be}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}\) - these elements belong to the same period. Generally the value of \(1^{\text {st }}\) ionisation potential increases on moving from left to right in a period, since the nuclear charge of the elements also increase in the same direction. But the ionisation potential of boron ( \(\mathrm{B} \rightarrow 2 s^{2} 2 p^{1}\) ) is lower than that of beryllium ( \(\mathrm{Be} \rightarrow 2 s^{2}\) ), since
in case of boron, \(2 p^{1}\) electron has to be removed to get \(\mathrm{B}^{+}\) while in case of \(\mathrm{Be}\left(2 s^{2}\right), s\)-electron has to be removed to get \(\mathrm{Be}^{+}\left(2 s^{1}\right) . p\)-electron can be removed more easily than \(s\)-electron so the energy required to remove electron will be less in case of boron. The order will be \(\mathrm{Li}<\mathrm{B}<\mathrm{Be}<\mathrm{C}\).
37. (a) : The energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from an isolated gaseous atom is called the ionisation energy. The ionisation potential increases as the size of the atom decreases. Atoms with fully or partly filled orbitals have high ionisation potential.
38. (c) : Among the halogens the electron affinity value of ' \(F\) ' should be maximum. But due to small size there is interelectronic repulsion thus, there is difficulty in entry of new electrons. Thus, the E.A. value is slightly lower than chlorine and the order is \(\mathrm{I}<\mathrm{Br}<\mathrm{F}<\mathrm{Cl}\).
39. (d) : \({ }_{4} \mathrm{Be} \rightarrow 1 s^{2} 2 s^{2},{ }_{5} \mathrm{~B} \rightarrow 1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{1}\)

Due to stable fully-filled ' \(s\) '-orbital arrangement of electrons in 'Be' atom, more energy is required to remove an electron from the valence shell than ' B '-atom. Therefore ' Be ' has higher ionisation potential than ' B '.
40. (b) : Positive ion is always smaller and negative ion is always larger than the parent atom.
41. (d) : Since all of these ions contain 18 electrons each, so these are isoelectronic. For isoelectronic ions, the anion having large negative charge is the largest in size i.e., \(\mathrm{S}^{2-}\).
42. (a) : These are isoelectronic ions (ions with same number of electrons) and for isoelectronic ions, greater the positive charge, greater is the force of attraction on the electrons by the nucleus and the smaller is the size of the ion. Thus, \(\mathrm{Al}^{3+}\) has the smallest size.
43. (b) : \(\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\) and ZnO are amphoteric. \(\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}\) is strongly acidic. MgO is the most basic.
44. (c) : The cations are always smaller than the neutral atom and anions are always larger in size, \(\mathrm{Na}^{-}>\mathrm{Na}>\mathrm{Na}^{+}\).
45. (c) : In isoelectronic ions, the size of the cation decreases as the magnitude of the positive charge increases.
46. (d) : Within a period from left to right, atomic volume first decreases and then increases.
47. (d) : Abnormally high difference between \(2^{\text {nd }}\) and \(3^{\text {rd }}\) ionisation energy means that the element has two valence electrons, which is a case in configuration (d).
48. (d)
49. (c) : The order of ionic size for given ions will be \(\mathrm{K}^{+}>\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}>\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\) and that of \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}>\mathrm{F}^{-}\). Therefore, \(\mathrm{MgCl}_{2}\) has minimum value of cation/anion ( \(\mathrm{Mg}^{2+} / \mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)) ratio.
50. (c) : N, O and F are highly electronegative non-metals and will have the strongest tendency to form anions by gaining electrons from metal atoms.
51. (c) : As halogens have seven electrons \(\left(n s^{2} n p^{5}\right)\) in the valence shell, they have a strong tendency to acquire the nearest inert gas configuration by gaining an electron from the metallic atom and form halide ions easily.
52. (a) : Metallic character decreases in a period and increases in a group.
53. (c) : The atomic size decreases within a period from left to right, therefore \(\mathrm{Li}>\mathrm{Be}\) and \(\mathrm{Na}>\mathrm{Mg}\). The size increases in a group from top to bottom. Hence, the size of Na is greater than Li . Overall order \(\mathrm{Na}>\mathrm{Mg}>\mathrm{Li}>\mathrm{Be}\). Thus, Be has smallest size.

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (c) : \(\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}, \mathrm{BeCl}_{2}\) and \(\mathrm{PCl}_{5}\) do not have eight electrons around central atom in their outermost shells.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-038.jpg?height=186&width=684&top_left_y=991&top_left_x=178)
2. (a) : The total charge \(=-3\)

So, the average formal charge on each ' O ' atom is \(-3 / 4=-0.75\)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-038.jpg?height=186&width=773&top_left_y=1251&top_left_x=134)

⇒ Average \(\mathrm{P}-\mathrm{O}\) bond order
\(=\frac{\text { Total no. of bonds }}{\text { Total no. of resonating structures }}=\frac{5}{4}=1.25\)
3. (c) : Along the period, as we move from \(\mathrm{Li} \rightarrow \mathrm{Be} \rightarrow \mathrm{B} \rightarrow \mathrm{C}\), the electronegativity increases and hence the \(E N\) difference between the element and Cl decreases and accordingly, the covalent character increases. Thus \(\mathrm{LiCl}<\mathrm{BeCl}_{2}<\mathrm{BCl}_{3}<\mathrm{CCl}_{4}\) is the correct order of covalent bond character.
4. (d)
<smiles>O=[C-](O)=C</smiles>

The asterisk (*) marked carbon has a valency of 5 and hence, this formula is not correct because carbon has a maximum valency of 4 . 5. (b) : For compounds containing ions of same charge, lattice energy increases as the size of ions decreases. Thus, NaF has highest lattice energy.
6. (d) : Ozone, \(\mathrm{O}_{3}\) :

Dipole moment of \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\) and \(\mathrm{NF}_{3}\) : Although F is more electronegative than H , the resultant dipole moment of \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\)
is much more than that of \(\mathrm{NF}_{3}\). It can be concluded from the following diagrams :

7. (d) : A given molecule posses dipole moment as a result of polarisation. Polarisation arises in a heteronuclear molecule due to significant electronegativity difference between atoms involved in covalent bond formation. The shared electron pair gets displaced towards more electronegative atom and the resultant covalent bond is polar covalent bond.
Thus, the correct order is: \(\mathrm{HF}>\mathrm{NH}_{3}>\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}>\mathrm{CH}_{4}\)

In \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}, \mathrm{H}\) is less electronegative than N and hence dipole moment of each \(\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{H}\) bond is towards N and create high net dipole moment whereas in \(\mathrm{NF}_{3}, \mathrm{~F}\) is more electronegative than N , the dipole moment of each \(\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{F}\) bond is opposite to that of lone pair, hence reducing the net dipole moment.

More single bond character in resonance hybrid, more is the bond length. Hence, the increasing bond length is
\[
\mathrm{CO}<\mathrm{CO}_{2}<\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}
\]
18. (c) : The dipole moment of \(\mathrm{NF}_{3}\) is 0.24 D and of \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\) is 1.48 D . The difference is due to fact that the dipole moment due to \(\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{F}\) bonds in \(\mathrm{NF}_{3}\) are in opposite directions to the direction of the dipole moment of the lone pair on N atom which partly cancel out. The dipole moment of \(\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{H}\) bonds in \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\) are in the same direction of the dipole moment of the lone pair on N atom which adds up as shown :
19. (d) : Bond lengths of \(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{O}\) in \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) is \(1.21 \AA\), in \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\) is \(1.48 \AA\) and in \(\mathrm{O}_{3}\) is \(1.28 \AA\). Therefore, correct order of the \(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{O}\) bond length is \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}>\mathrm{O}_{3}>\mathrm{O}_{2}\).
20. (c) : Covalent character in a compound is found by Fajan's rule.
Fajan's rule : The smaller the size of the cation and the larger the size of the anion, the greater is the covalent character of an ionic bond. The greater the charge on the cation, the greater is the covalent character of the ionic bond.
21. (b) : For dipole moment, we have to know the hybridisation and shape.
22. (d) : The overall value of the dipole moment of a polar molecule depends on its geometry and shape, i.e., vectorial addition of dipole moment of the constituent bonds. Water has angular structure with bond angle \(104.5^{\circ}\), it has dipole moment. However \(\mathrm{BeF}_{2}\) is a linear molecule thus, dipole moment summation of all the bonds present in the molecule cancel each other.

\]
23. (a) : The structure of \(\mathrm{CS}_{2}\) is linear and therefore it does not have permanent dipole moment. It is represented as \(\mathrm{S}=\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{S}\).
24. (b) : Smaller the atom, stronger is the bond and greater is the bond dissociation energy. Therefore, the bond \(C-D\) has the greatest energy or \(D\) has smallest atoms.
25. (a) : According to Fajans rule, ionic character increases with increase in size of the cation, ( \(\mathrm{Cs}>\mathrm{Rb}>\mathrm{K}>\mathrm{Na}\) ) and with decrease in size of the anion ( \(\mathrm{F}>\mathrm{Cl}>\mathrm{Br}>\mathrm{I}\) ). Thus, CsF has higher ionic character than NaCl and hence, bond in CsF is stronger than in NaCl .
26. (c) : Polarity of the bond depends upon the electronegativity difference of the two atoms forming the bond. Greater the electronegativity difference, more is the polarity of the bond.

Out of these three geometries, it is only trigonal bipyramidal shape in which bond pair-bond pair repulsions are minimum and hence, this geometry is the most probable geometry of \(A B_{5}\) molecule.
34. (b) : \(\mathrm{SiCl}_{4}, \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}, \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}\) and \(\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}\) ions are the examples of molecules/ions which are of \(A B_{4}\) type and have tetrahedral structures. \(\mathrm{SCl}_{4}\) is \(A B_{4}\) (lone pair) type species. Although the arrangement of five \(s p^{3} d\) hybrid orbitals in space is trigonal bipyramidal, due to the presence of one lone pair of electrons in the basal hybrid orbital, the shape of \(A B_{4}\) (lone pair) species gets distorted and becomes distorted tetrahedral or see-saw.

B.O. \(=\frac{1}{2}(10-5)=2.5\)
90. (d) : \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\)(17) superoxide has one unpaired electron. \(\sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \pi^{*} 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi^{*} 2 p_{y}^{1}\)
91. (a) : \(\mathrm{CO}=6+8=14\) electrons
\(\mathrm{NO}^{+}=7+8-1=14\) electrons
Electronic configuration of \(\mathrm{NO}^{+}\):
\(\sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2} \pi 2 p_{y}^{2}\)
Electronic configuration of CO :
\(\sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2} \pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2}\)
So, both have bond order \(=\frac{10-4}{2}=3\)
92. (c) : Molecular orbital configuration of
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}(16): \sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \pi^{*} 2 p_{x}^{1}=\pi^{*} 2 p_{y}^{1}\)
⇒ Paramagnetic
Bond order \(=\frac{10-6}{2}=2\)
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}(15): \sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \pi^{*} 2 p_{x}^{1}\)
⇒ Paramagnetic ; Bond order \(=\frac{10-5}{2}=2.5\)
\(\mathrm{C}_{2}(12): \sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2}\)
⇒ Diamagnetic ; Bond order \(=\frac{8-4}{2}=2\)
\(\mathrm{C}_{2}^{+}(11): \sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{1}\)
⇒ Paramagnetic ; Bond order \(=\frac{7-4}{2}=1.5\)
\(\mathrm{NO}(15): \sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \pi^{*} 2 p_{x}^{1}\)
⇒ Paramagnetic ; Bond order \(=\frac{10-5}{2}=2.5\)
\(\mathrm{NO}^{+}(14): \sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2}\)
⇒ Diamagnetic ; Bond order \(=\frac{10-4}{2}=3\)
\(\mathrm{N}_{2}(14): \sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2}\)
⇒ Diamagnetic ; Bond order \(=\frac{10-4}{2}=3\)
\(\mathrm{N}_{2}^{+}(13): \sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{1}\)
⇒ Paramagnetic
Bond order \(=\frac{9-4}{2}=2.5\)
Thus from \(\mathrm{NO} \rightarrow \mathrm{NO}^{+}\), bond order increases i.e., bond energy increases and magnetic behaviour changes from paramagnetic to diamagnetic.
93. (a): \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-} \rightarrow 1.0 \quad \mathrm{~B}_{2} \rightarrow 1.0\)

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+} \rightarrow 2.5\) & \(\mathrm{NO}^{+} \rightarrow 3.0\) \\
\(\mathrm{NO} \rightarrow 2.5\) & \(\mathrm{CO} \rightarrow 3.0\) \\
\(\mathrm{~N}_{2} \rightarrow 3.0\) & \(\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow 2.0\)
\end{tabular}
94. (a) : Electronic configuration of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}(16)\)
\[
\begin{array}{r}
\sigma(1 s)^{2} \sigma^{*}(1 s)^{2} \sigma(2 s)^{2} \sigma^{*}(2 s)^{2} \sigma\left(2 p_{z}\right)^{2} \pi\left(2 p_{x}\right)^{2}=\pi\left(2 p_{y}\right)^{2} \pi^{*}\left(2 p_{x}\right)^{1} \\
=\pi^{*}\left(2 p_{y}\right)^{1}
\end{array}
\]

Thus, the incoming electron will enter in \(\pi^{*} 2 p_{x}\) to form \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\).
95. (d) :

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Diatomic species & Bond order \\
\hline NO & 2.5 \\
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\) & 1.5 \\
\(\mathrm{C}_{2}^{2-}\) & 3.0 \\
\(\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}\) & 0.5 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Thus, bond order increases as: \(\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}<\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}<\mathrm{NO}<\mathrm{C}_{2}^{2-}\)
96. (c) : In CO , the number of electrons \(=6+8=14\)

Molecular orbital electronic configuration of
CO : \((\sigma 1 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 1 s\right)^{2}(\sigma 2 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 2 s\right)^{2}\left(\pi 2 p_{x}\right)^{2}=\left(\pi 2 p_{y}\right)^{2}\left(\sigma 2 p_{z}\right)^{2}\)
\(\mathrm{CN}^{-}\)have also get \((6+7+1) 14\) electrons and the configuration is similar to that of CO .
\(\mathrm{CN}^{-}\)and CO are isoelectronic species.
97. (c) : In ' CO ' (14 electrons), there is no unpaired electron in its molecular orbital. Therefore, this does not exhibit paramagnetism.
98. (d) : \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}(18):(\sigma 1 s)^{2},\left(\sigma^{*} 1 s\right)^{2},(\sigma 2 s)^{2},\left(\sigma^{*} 2 s\right)^{2},\left(\sigma 2 p_{z}\right)^{2},\left(\pi 2 p_{x}\right)^{2} =\left(\pi 2 p_{y}\right)^{2},\left(\pi^{*} 2 p_{x}\right)^{2}=\left(\pi^{*} 2 p_{y}\right)^{2}\)
Thus, the no. of antibonding electrons in \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}\) ion is 8 (4 pairs).
99. (d) : As per their molecular orbital electronic configurations
\(\mathrm{CO}, \mathrm{CN}^{-}\)and \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}\) are diamagnetic and NO is paramagnetic.
100. (d) : \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}: \sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \pi^{*} 2 p_{x}^{1}\)

Due to the presence of one unpaired electron, \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}\)is paramagnetic in nature.
101. (a) : \(\mathrm{He}_{2}\) does not exist as it has zero bond order.
\(\mathrm{He}_{2}: \sigma l s^{2}, \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2}\)
Bond order \(=\frac{1}{2}\left(N_{b}-N_{a}\right)=\frac{1}{2}(2-2)=0\)
102. (d) : \(\mathrm{Be}_{2}(8): K K \sigma(2 s)^{2} \sigma^{*}(2 s)^{2}\)
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}(16): K K \sigma(2 s)^{2} \sigma^{*}(2 s)^{2} \sigma\left(2 p_{z}\right)^{2} \pi\left(2 p_{x}\right)^{2}=\pi\left(2 p_{y}\right)^{2} \pi^{*}\left(2 p_{x}\right)^{1} =\pi^{*}\left(2 p_{y}\right)^{1}\)
\(\mathrm{N}_{2}(14): K K \sigma(2 s)^{2} \sigma^{*}(2 s)^{2} \pi\left(2 p_{x}\right)^{2}=\pi\left(2 p_{y}\right)^{2} \sigma\left(2 p_{z}\right)^{2}\)
\(\mathrm{C}_{2}(12): K K \sigma(2 s)^{2} \sigma^{*}(2 s)^{2} \pi\left(2 p_{x}\right)^{2}=\pi\left(2 p_{y}\right)^{2}\)
Therefore, \(\mathrm{C}_{2}\) contains \(2 \pi\) bonds as it has 4 electrons in two pi-molecular orbitals.
103. (d) : \(\mathrm{N}_{2}(14): K K \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2}\); Diamagnetic \(\mathrm{H}_{2}(2): \sigma 1 s^{2}\); Diamagnetic

\(\mathrm{O}_{2}(16): \sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \pi^{*} 2 p_{x}^{1}=\pi^{*} 2 p_{y}^{1}\); Paramagnetic
104. (d) : \(\mathrm{O}_{2}(16): K K \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \pi^{*} 2 p_{x}^{1}=\pi^{*} 2 p_{y}^{1}\)

Bond order \(=\frac{1}{2}(8-4)=2\)
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}(18): K K \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \pi^{*} 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi^{*} 2 p_{y}^{2}\)
Bond order \(=\frac{1}{2}(8-6)=1\)
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}(17): K K \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \pi^{*} 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi^{*} 2 p_{y}^{1}\)
Bond order \(=\frac{1}{2}(8-5)=1.5\)
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}(15): K K \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \pi^{*} 2 p_{x}^{1}\)
Bond order \(=\frac{1}{2}(8-3)=2.5\)
As, bond order \(\propto\) stability
The decreasing order of stability is
\[
\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}>\mathrm{O}_{2}>\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}>\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}
\]
105. (b) : \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}<\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}<\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2+}\)
B.O. : 1.52 .53 .0
106. (b) : Configuration of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) (16) :
\(\sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2} \sigma 2 p_{z}^{2} \pi 2 p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2 p_{y}^{2} \pi^{*} 2 p_{x}^{1}=\pi^{*} 2 p_{y}^{1}\)
Bond order \(=\frac{\begin{array}{l}\text { No. of } e^{-} \text {in } \\ \text { bonding M.O. }\end{array}-\begin{array}{l}\text { No. of } e^{-} \text {in } \\ \text { antibonding M.O. }\end{array}}{2}\)
Bond order of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}=\frac{10-5}{2}=2.5\)
Bond order of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}=\frac{10-7}{2}=1.5\)
Bond order of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}=\frac{10-8}{2}=1.0\)
Bond order of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}=\frac{10-6}{2}=2\)
107. (a) : Electronic configuration
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}: K K(\sigma 2 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 2 s\right)^{2}\left(\sigma 2 p_{z}\right)^{2}\left(\pi 2 p_{x}\right)^{2}=\left(\pi 2 p_{y}\right)^{2}\left(\pi^{*} 2 p_{x}\right)^{1}=\left(\pi^{*} 2 p_{y}\right)^{1}\)

Bond order \(=\frac{1}{2}(8-4)=2\);
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}:\)Bond order \(=\frac{1}{2}(8-3)=2 \frac{1}{2}\)
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}:\)Bond order \(=\frac{1}{2}(8-5)=1 \frac{1}{2}\)
\(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}:\) Bond order \(=\frac{1}{2}(8-6)=1\)
As bond order increases, bond length decreases.
108. (c) : \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}\)and \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) are paramagnetic in nature as they contain one and two unpaired electrons respectively.
109. (b) : \(\mathrm{Be}_{2}\) does not exist.
\(\mathrm{Be}_{2}\) has an electronic configuration of:
\(\sigma 1 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 1 s^{2} \sigma 2 s^{2} \sigma^{*} 2 s^{2}\)
\(\therefore \quad\) Bond order \(=\frac{4-4}{2}=0\) Thus, \(\mathrm{Be}_{2}\) does not exist.
110. (a) : According to MOT, the molecular orbital electronic configuration of
\(\mathrm{N}_{2}(14):(\sigma 1 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 1 s\right)^{2}(\sigma 2 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 2 s\right)^{2}\left(\pi 2 p_{x}\right)^{2}=\left(\pi 2 p_{y}\right)^{2}\left(\sigma 2 p_{z}\right)^{2}\)
\(\therefore \quad\) B.O \(=\frac{10-4}{2}=3\)
\(\mathrm{N}_{2}^{-}(15):(\sigma 1 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 1 s\right)^{2}(\sigma 2 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 2 s\right)^{2}\left(\pi 2 p_{x}\right)^{2}=\left(\pi 2 p_{y}\right)^{2}\)
\(\left(\sigma 2 p_{z}\right)^{2}\left(\pi^{*} 2 p_{x}\right)^{1}\)
\(\therefore \quad\) B.O \(=\frac{10-5}{2}=2.5\)
\(\mathrm{N}_{2}^{2-}(16):(\sigma 1 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 1 s\right)^{2}(\sigma 2 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 2 s\right)^{2}\left(\pi 2 p_{x}\right)^{2}=\left(\pi 2 p_{y}\right)^{2} \left(\sigma 2 p_{z}\right)^{2}\left(\pi^{*} 2 p_{x}\right)^{1}=\left(\pi^{*} 2 p_{y}\right)^{1}\)
\(\therefore \quad\) B.O. \(=\frac{10-6}{2}=2\)
Hence, bond order increases as : \(\mathrm{N}_{2}^{2-}<\mathrm{N}_{2}^{-}<\mathrm{N}_{2}\)
111. (a) : \(\mathrm{N}_{2}(14):(\sigma 1 s)^{2},\left(\sigma^{*} 1 s\right)^{2},(\sigma 2 s)^{2},\left(\sigma^{*} 2 s\right)^{2}\)
\(\left(\pi 2 p_{x}\right)^{2},\left(\pi 2 p_{y}\right)^{2},\left(\sigma 2 p_{z}\right)^{2}\)
In \(N_{2}\), bond order \(=\frac{N_{b}-N_{a}}{2}=\frac{10-4}{2}=3\)
In \(\mathrm{N}_{2}^{+}\), bond order \(=\frac{9-4}{2}=2 \cdot 5\)

As the bond order in \(\mathrm{N}_{2}\) is more than \(\mathrm{N}_{2}^{+}\)so the dissociation energy of \(\mathrm{N}_{2}\) is higher than \(\mathrm{N}_{2}^{+}\).
112. (b) : Diamagnetism is caused due to the absence of unpaired electrons. But in \(\mathrm{N}_{2}^{+}\), there is unpaired electron. So, it is paramagnetic.
113. (b) : \(\mathrm{N}_{2}^{-}\)becomes paramagnetic due to one unpaired electron in \(\pi^{*} 2 p_{x}\) orbital.
114. (b) : Number of electrons in bonding orbitals, \(N_{b}=10\) and number of electrons in antibonding orbitals, \(N_{a}=4\).
Therefore bond order \(=1 / 2\left(N_{b}-N_{a}\right)=1 / 2(10-4)=3\)
115. (c): The bond order of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}=2.5, \mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}=1\), \(\mathrm{O}_{2}=1.5\) and that of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}=2\).
116. (a):o-Nitrophenol shows intramolecular hydrogen bonding.
<smiles>O=[N+]1[CH]Oc2ccccc21</smiles>
117. (c) : \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{HCN}\) and conc. \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\) form intermolecular hydrogen bonding while cellulose has intramolecular hydrogen bonding.
118. (d) : Methanol can undergo intermolecular association through H -bonding as the -OH group in alcohols is highly polarised.
<smiles>[CH][I+]OC(OC)OC</smiles>

As a result, in order to convert liquid \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}\) to gaseous state, the strong hydrogen bonds must be broken.
119. (a) : \({ }^{\delta-} \mathrm{X}-\mathrm{H}^{\delta+} \ldots . . \mathrm{Y}\), the electrons of the covalent bond are shited towards the more electronegative atom. This partially positively charged H -atom forms hydrogen bond with the other more electronegative atom.
120. (c) : \(\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{F}\) shows strongest H -bonds because fluorine is most electronegative.
121. (a) : \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) shows maximum H -bonding because each \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) molecule is linked to four \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) molecules through H-bonds.

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (d) : Isothermal process : Temperature of the system remains constant ( \(\Delta T=0\) ). (A-II)
Isochoric process : Volume of the system remains constant ( \(\Delta V=0\) ). (B-III)
Isobaric process : Pressure of the system remains constant \((\Delta P=0)\). (C-IV)

Adiabatic process : The system does not exchange heat with the surroundings \((q=0)\). (D-I)
2. (b) : State functions or state variables are those which depend only on the state of the system and not on how the state was reached.
\(\left.\begin{array}{c}q+w=\Delta E \text { (internal energy) } \\ H-T S=G \text { (free energy) }\end{array}\right\}\) State functions
Path function depends on the path followed during a process. Work and heat are the path functions.
3. (a) : The mathematical form of first law of thermodynamics : \(q=\Delta E+w\)
Since the system is closed and insulated, \(q=0\)
Paddle work is done on system. \(\therefore w \neq 0\).
Temperature and hence internal energy of the system increases.
\(\therefore \quad \Delta E \neq 0\).
4. (b) : This is the mathematical relation of first law of thermodynamics. Here \(\Delta U=\) change in internal energy; \(\Delta Q=\) heat absorbed by the system and \(W=\) work done by the system.
5. (b) : \(w=-2.303 n R T \log \frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\)
or \(w=-2.303 n R T \log \frac{P_{1}}{P_{2}}\)
\[
=-2.303 \times 1 \times 2 \times 298 \times \log \frac{20}{10}=-413.14 \text { calories }
\]
6. (d) : \(\Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta n_{g} R T\)
7. (b)
8. (c) : \(C_{P}=C_{V}+n R\)

For one mole of ideal gas,
\[
C_{P}=C_{V}+R \text { or } C_{P}-C_{V}=R
\]
9. (a) : For free expansion of an ideal gas, \(P_{e x}=0\), \(w=-P_{e x} \Delta V=0\)
For adiabatic process, \(q=0\)
According to first law of thermodynamics,
\(\Delta U=q+w=0\)
As internal energy of an ideal gas is a function of temperature, \(\Delta U=0, \therefore \Delta T=0\)
10. (b) : Expansion of a gas against a constant external pressure is an irreversible process. The work done in an irreversible process
\(=-P_{\text {ext }} \Delta \mathrm{V}=-P_{\text {ext }}\left(V_{2}-V_{1}\right)=-2(0.25-0.1)\)
\(=-2 \times 0.15 \mathrm{~L}\) bar \(=-0.30 \times 100 \mathrm{~J}=-30 \mathrm{~J}\)
11. (d) : For an ideal gas, internal energy is a function of temperature. Final temperature i.e., \(T_{C}\) for adiabatic process is less than its initial temperature i.e., \(T_{A}\)
\(\therefore \quad T_{C}<T_{A}\)
12. (b) : \(w=-P d V=-P\left(V_{2}-V_{1}\right)\)
\(=-10^{5} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}\left(10^{-2}-10^{-3}\right) \mathrm{m}^{3}=-10^{5} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}\left(9 \times 10^{-3}\right) \mathrm{m}^{3}\)
\(=-9 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}=-900 \mathrm{~J} \quad(\because 1 \mathrm{~J}=1 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m})\)
13. (b) : \(w=-P_{\text {ext }} \Delta V=-2.5(4.50-2.50)\)
\(=-5 \mathrm{~L} \mathrm{~atm}=-5 \times 101.325 \mathrm{~J}=-506.625 \mathrm{~J}\)
\(\Delta U=q+w\)
As, the container is insulated, thus \(q=0\)
Hence, \(\Delta U=w=-506.625 \mathrm{~J}\)
14. (d) : \(C_{p}\) for monoatomic gas mixture of same volume \(=\frac{5}{2} R, C_{V}=\frac{3}{2} R \quad \therefore \quad \frac{C_{P}}{C_{V}}=\frac{\frac{5}{2} R}{\frac{3}{2} R}=\frac{5}{3}=1.67\)
15. (c) : For free expansion of an ideal gas under adiabatic condition \(q=0, \Delta T=0, w=0\).

For free expansion, \(w=0\), adiabatic process, \(q=0\)
\(\Delta U=q+w=0\)
Internal energy remain constant means \(\Delta T=0\).
16. (d) : Since the ideal gas expands spontaneously into vacuum, \(P_{\text {ext }}=0\), hence work done is also zero.
17. (b) : \(\Delta H=\Delta E+\Delta n_{g} R T\)

For \(\mathrm{H}_{2(g)}+\mathrm{Br}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HBr}_{(g)}\)
\(\Delta n_{g}=2-(1+1)=0\). i.e. \(\Delta H=\Delta E\)
18. (b) : Work \(=-P_{\text {ext }} \times\) volume change
\(=-3 \times(6-4) \times 101.32=6 \times 101.32=-607.92 \mathrm{~J} \approx-608 \mathrm{~J}\)
19. (b) : \(\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8(g)}+5 \mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{CO}_{2(g)}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)}\)
\(\Delta n_{g}=3-6=-3\)
\(\Delta H=\Delta E+P \Delta V\) or \(\Delta H-\Delta E=P \Delta V\)
\(\Delta H-\Delta E=\Delta n_{g} R T=-3 R T\)
20. (b) : Molar heat capacity \(=75 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)

18 g of water \(=1 \mathrm{~mole}=75 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
1 g of water \(=\frac{75}{18} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}\)
100 g of water \(=\frac{75}{18} \times 100 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}\)
\(Q=m \cdot C \cdot \Delta T\) or \(1000=100 \times \frac{75}{18} \times \Delta T\)
\(\Rightarrow \Delta T=\frac{10 \times 18}{75}=2.4 \mathrm{~K}\)
21. (b) : \(\Delta H=\Delta E+P \Delta V\)

When \(\Delta V=0 ; w=0\).
\(\Delta H=\Delta E+0\) or \(\Delta H=\Delta E\)
As \(\Delta E=q+w, \Delta E=q\)
In the present problem, \(\Delta H=500 \mathrm{~J}\),
\(\Delta H=\Delta E=500 \mathrm{~J}, q=500 \mathrm{~J}, w=0\)
22. (a) : \(\Delta H=\Delta E+P \Delta V\)
also \(P V=n R T\) (ideal gas equation)
or \(P \Delta V=\Delta n_{g} R T\)
\(\Delta n_{g}=\) Change in number of gaseous moles
\(\therefore \quad \Delta H=\Delta E+\Delta n_{g} R T \Rightarrow \Delta n_{g}=2-3=-1\)
\(\Rightarrow \Delta H=\Delta E-R T\)
23. (b) : In endothermic reactions, energy of reactants is less than energy of products. Thus, \(E_{R}<E_{P}\).
\(\Delta H=E_{P}-E_{R}=+\mathrm{ve}\)
24. (b) : Change in internal energy depends upon temperature. At constant temperature, the internal energy of the gas remains constant, so \(\Delta E=0\).
25. (c) : During isothermal expansion of an ideal gas,
\(\Delta T=0, \Delta E=0 \therefore \Delta H=0\)
\[
H=E+P V
\]
\(\because \Delta H=\Delta E+\Delta(P V)=\Delta E+\Delta(n R T)\)
\(\therefore \quad \Delta H=\Delta E+n R \Delta T=0+0=0\)
Change in enthalpy is zero, means its enthalpy remains same or unaffected.
26. (b) : \(\Delta n_{g}=2-4=-2, \Delta H=\Delta E-2 R T\)
27. (d) : If \(n_{p}<n_{r} ; \Delta n_{g}=n_{p}-n_{r}=-\mathrm{ve}\).

Hence, \(\Delta H<\Delta E\).
28. (b) : Decomposition for 1 mole of water,
\(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(g)} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2(g)}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2(g)} ; \Delta H=+\frac{483.64 \mathrm{~kJ}}{2}\)
\(\Delta H=+241.82 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
29. (b) : According to Hess's law, equation (i) is equal to equations (ii) + (iii) i.e., \(x=y+z\)
30. (a) : \(\Delta_{\text {vap }} H^{\circ}=40.66 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
\(T=100+273=373 \mathrm{~K}, \Delta E=\) ?
\(\Delta H=\Delta E+\Delta n_{g} R T \Rightarrow \Delta E=\Delta H-\Delta n_{g} R T\)
\(\Delta n_{g}=\) number of gaseous moles of products
- number of gaseous moles of reactants
\(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(g)}\)
\(\Delta n_{g}=1-0=1\)
\(\Delta E=\Delta H-R T\)
\(\Delta E=\left(40.66 \times 10^{3}\right)-(8.314 \times 373)\)
\(=37559 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol}\) or \(37.56 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}\)
31. (b) : Adding all the equations, we get
\(\Delta H\)

\begin{tabular}{lr}
\(A \rightarrow 2 B\) & \(300 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}\) \\
\(3 B \rightarrow 2 C+D\) & \(-125 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}\) \\
\(2 D \rightarrow A+E\) & \(-350 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}\) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\[
B+D \rightarrow E+2 C ; \Delta H=(300-125-350)=-175 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}
\]
32. (d) : \(\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3(s)}+3 \mathrm{CO}_{(g)} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Fe}_{(s)}+3 \mathrm{CO}_{2(g)}\);
\[
\Delta H=-26.8 \mathrm{~kJ}
\]
\(\mathrm{FeO}_{(s)}+\mathrm{CO}_{(g)} \rightarrow \mathrm{Fe}_{(s)}+\mathrm{CO}_{2(g)} ; \Delta H=-16.5 \mathrm{~kJ}\)
\(\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3(s)}+\mathrm{CO}_{(g)} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{FeO}_{(s)}+\mathrm{CO}_{2(g)} ; \Delta H=\) ?

Eq. (iii) can be obtained as :
(i) -2 (ii) \(=-26.8-2(-16.5)=-26.8+33.0=+6.2 \mathrm{~kJ}\)
33. (c) : For (c), \(\Delta H^{\circ}{ }_{\text {reaction }}\)
\[
=\Delta H_{f}^{\circ}\left(\mathrm{XeF}_{4}\right)-\left[\Delta H_{f}^{\circ}(\mathrm{Xe})+2 \Delta H_{f}^{\circ}\left(\mathrm{F}_{2}\right)\right]
\]

Enthalpies of formation of elementary substances Xe and \(\mathrm{F}_{2}\) are taken as zero.
Thus, \(\Delta H_{\text {reaction }}^{\circ}=\Delta H_{f}^{\circ}\left(\mathrm{XeF}_{4}\right)\)
34. (a) : (i) \(\mathrm{C}_{(s)}+\mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2(g)}\); \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{i}}=-94 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}\)
(ii) \(2 \mathrm{H}_{2(g)}+\mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)} ; \Delta H_{\mathrm{ii}}=-68 \times 2 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}\)
(iii) \(\mathrm{CH}_{4(g)}+2 \mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2(g)}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)} ; \Delta H_{\text {iii }}=-213 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}\)
(iv) \(\mathrm{C}_{(s)}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2(g)} \rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{4(g)} ; \Delta H_{\text {iv }}=\) ?

By applying Hess's law, we can compute \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{iv}}\).
\[
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \Delta H_{\mathrm{iv}} & =\Delta H_{\mathrm{i}}+\Delta H_{\mathrm{ii}}-\Delta H_{\mathrm{iii}} \\
& =(-94-68 \times 2+213) \mathrm{kcal}=-17 \mathrm{kcal}

Subtracting (ii) from (i), we get
\(\mathrm{CH}_{4}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}, \Delta H_{3}=-\mathrm{ve}\)
i.e., \(\quad-x-(-y)=-\mathrm{ve}\)

Amount of heat released on formation of \(44 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{CO}_{2}=393.5 \mathrm{~kJ}\)
∴ Amount of heat released on formation of 35.2 g of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\)
\(=\frac{393.5}{44} \times 35.2=314.8 \approx 315 \mathrm{~kJ}\)
Note: -ve or +ve sign considering the reaction is exothermic or endothermic.
42. (b) : \(\mathrm{CH}_{4}+2 \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
\(\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}+5 \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
No. of moles in gaseous mixture
\[
\mathrm{CH}_{4}+\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}=\frac{5}{22.4}=0.22 \mathrm{moles}
\]

No. of moles of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}=\frac{16}{22.4}=0.71\) moles
Let \(x\) moles of \(\mathrm{CH}_{4}\) is there in a gaseous mixture so, number of moles of \(\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}\) would be \(0.22-x\). Then moles of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) consumed, \(2 x+(0.22-x) 5=0.71\) or \(x=0.13\)
Total amount of heat liberated \(=0.13 \times 890+0.09 \times 2220=315.5 \mathrm{~kJ}\)
43. (c) : The dissociation energy of \(\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H}\) bond is \(\frac{869.6}{2}=434.8 \mathrm{~kJ}\)
44. (b) : For the given reaction, enthalpy of reaction can be calculated as
\(=\Sigma B . E\). (reactants) \(-\Sigma B . E\). (products)
\(=\left[B \cdot E_{\cdot(\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C})}+B \cdot E_{\cdot(\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H})}+4 \times B \cdot E \cdot{ }_{(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H})}\right]-\left[B \cdot E_{\cdot(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C})}+6 \times B \cdot E \cdot{ }_{(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H})}\right]\)
\(=[606.10+431.37+4 \times 410.50]-[336.49+6 \times 410.50]\)
\(=2679.47-2799.49=-120.02 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
45. (a) : \(\mathrm{H}_{2}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HCl}\)
\(\Delta H_{\text {reaction }}=\Sigma(B \cdot E)_{\text {reactants }}-\Sigma(B \cdot E)_{\text {products }}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& =\left[(B \cdot E)_{\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H}}+(B \cdot E)_{\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{Cl}}\right]-\left[2 B \cdot E_{(\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{Cl})}\right] \\
& =434+242-(431) \times 2 \\
\Delta H_{\text {reaction }} & =-186 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
\]

Heat of formation is the amount of heat absorbed or evolved when one mole of substance is directly obtained from its constituent elements.
Hence, enthalpy of formation of \(\mathrm{HCl}=\frac{-186}{2}=-93 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
46. (d) : The amount of heat absorbed or released when 1 mole of a substance is directly obtained from its constituent elements is called the heat of formation or enthalpy of formation.
Equation (i) represents neutralisation reaction, (iii) represents hydrogenation reaction and (iv) represents combustion reaction.
Thus, enthalpy of formation of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)}\) is \(-X_{2} \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\).
47. (b) : \(\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}_{2}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{HCl}\)

\begin{aligned}
& \Delta H=\Sigma B \cdot E_{\cdot(\text { reactants })}-\Sigma B \cdot E_{\cdot(\text { products })} \\
& \quad=\frac{1}{2}\left[B \cdot E_{\cdot\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}\right)}+B \cdot E_{\cdot\left(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right)}\right]-B \cdot E \cdot(\mathrm{HCl})=-90 \\
& \frac{1}{2}(430+240)-B \cdot E \cdot(\mathrm{HCl})=-90 \\
& B \cdot E_{\cdot(\mathrm{HCl})}=\frac{1}{2}(430+240)+90=425 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}

Energy absorbed Energy released
Net energy released \(=728-625=103 \mathrm{~kJ}\)
i.e. \(\quad \Delta H^{\circ}=-103 \mathrm{~kJ}\)
49. (c) : A. Molecules in gaseous phase have greater freedom of movement, i.e., have greater randomness than those in liquid phase, hence entropy increases.
B. On decreasing temperature of a solid, entropy decreases.
C. As number of gaseous products increases, randomness increases.
D. The products have larger number of gaseous particles, hence entropy increases.
50. (d) : For reversible and irreversible expansion for an ideal gas under isothermal condition, \(\Delta U=0\), but \(\Delta S_{\text {total }}\) i.e., \(\Delta S_{\text {sys }}+\Delta S_{\text {Surr }}\) is not zero for irreversible process.
51. (d) : In the reaction, \(2 \mathrm{Cl}_{(g)} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_{2(g)}\), the randomness decreases as 2 moles of \(\mathrm{Cl}_{(g)}\) are converted to 1 mole of \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2(g)}\), thus, \(\Delta_{r} S<0\).
And this is an exothermic reaction, thus, \(\Delta_{r} H<0\).
52. (a) : If \(\Delta n_{g}<0\) then \(\Delta S<0\)
53. (a) : For a spontaneous reaction,
\(\Delta G<0\) i.e., \(\Delta H-T \Delta S<0\)
\(T>\frac{\Delta H}{\Delta S} ; T>\left(\frac{35.5 \times 1000}{83.6}=424.6\right) \approx 425 \mathrm{~K}\)
\(\therefore \quad T>425 \mathrm{~K}\)
54. (b) : For an ideal gas undergoing reversible expansion, when temperature changes from \(T_{i}\) to \(T_{f}\) and pressure changes from \(p_{i}\) to \(p_{f}\),
\(\Delta S=n C_{p} \ln \frac{T_{f}}{T_{i}}+n R \ln \frac{p_{i}}{p_{f}}\)
For an isothermal process, \(T_{i}=T_{f}\) so, \(\ln 1=0\)
\(\therefore \Delta S=n R \ln \frac{p_{i}}{p_{f}}\)
55. (a, c): \(\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S\)

If \(\Delta H<0\) and \(\Delta S>0\)
\(\Delta G=(-\mathrm{ve})-T(+\mathrm{ve})\)
then at all temperatures, \(\Delta G=-\mathrm{ve}\), spontaneous reaction.
If \(\Delta H<0\) and \(\Delta S=0\)
\(\Delta G=(-\mathrm{ve})-T(0)=-\mathrm{ve}\) at all temperatures.
56. (b) : This is Clausius-Clapeyron equation.
57. (b) : Using Gibbs'-Helmholtz equation,
\[
\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S
\]

During adsorption of a gas, entropy decreases i.e. \(\Delta S<0\)
For spontaneous adsorption, \(\Delta G\) should be negative, which is possible when \(\Delta H\) is highly negative.
58. (b) : \(\Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta n_{g} R T\)

Given, \(\Delta U=2.1 \mathrm{kcal}, \Delta n_{g}=2\),
\[
R=2 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{kcal}, T^{6}=300 \mathrm{~K}
\]
\(\therefore \quad \Delta H=2.1+2 \times 2 \times 10^{-3} \times 300=3.3 \mathrm{kcal}\)
Again, \(\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S\)
Given, \(\Delta S=20 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{kcal} \mathrm{K}^{-1}\)
On putting the values of \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) in the equation, we get
\(\Delta G=3.3-300 \times 20 \times 10^{-3}=3.3-6 \times 10^{3} \times 10^{-3}=-2.7 \mathrm{kcal}\)
59. (a) : \(\Delta H=\left(E_{a}\right)_{f}-\left(E_{a}\right)_{b}=0\)
60. (a) : \(\mathrm{C}_{\text {(graphite) }}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{(g)}\)
\(\Delta n_{g}=1-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{2}\)
As amount of gaseous substance is increasing in the product side thus, \(\Delta S\) is positive for this reaction.
And we know that \(\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S\)
As \(\Delta S\) is positive, thus increase in temperature will make the term ( \(-T \Delta S\) ) more negative and \(\Delta G\) will decrease.
61. (c) : \(\Delta H_{\text {fus }}=1.435 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}\)
\(\Delta S_{\text {fus }}=\frac{\Delta H_{\text {fus }}}{T_{\text {fus }}}=\frac{1.435 \times 10^{3}}{273}=5.26 \mathrm{cal} /(\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{K})\)
62. (d) : We know that \(\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S\)
\[
0=\Delta H-T \Delta S \quad \begin{gathered}
{[\because \Delta G=0 \text { as transition of }} \\
\left.\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(v)} \text { is at equilibrium }\right]
\end{gathered}
\]
\(\Delta S=\frac{\Delta H}{T}=\frac{30 \times 10^{3}}{300}=100 \mathrm{Jmol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}\)
63. (a) : Given reaction is :
\[
\frac{1}{2} X_{2}+\frac{3}{2} Y_{2} \rightleftharpoons X Y_{3}
\]

We know, \(\Delta S^{\circ}=\Sigma S^{\circ}{ }_{\text {products }}-\Sigma S^{\circ}{ }_{\text {reactants }}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& =50-\left(\frac{1}{2}(60)+\frac{3}{2}(40)\right) \\
& =50-(30+60)=-40 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
\]

At equilibrium \(\Delta G^{\circ}=0\)
\[
\Delta H^{\circ}=T \Delta S^{\circ}
\]
\(\therefore T=\frac{\Delta H^{\circ}}{\Delta S^{\circ}}=\frac{-30 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{Jmol}^{-1}}{-40 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}}=750 \mathrm{~K}\)
64. (c) : According to Gibbs equation,
\[
\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S
\]
when \(\Delta G=0, \Delta H=T \Delta S\)
Given, \(\Delta H=40.63 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}=40.63 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta S=108.8 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\
\therefore \quad & T=\frac{\Delta H}{\Delta S}=\frac{40.63 \times 10^{3}}{108.8}=373.43 \mathrm{~K}
\end{aligned}
\]
65. (b) : For the reaction to be spontaneous, \(\Delta G=-v e\).

Given : \(\Delta H=170 \mathrm{~kJ}=170 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}, \Delta S=170 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}\)
Applying, \(\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S\), the value of \(\Delta G=-\) ve only when \(T \Delta S>\Delta H\), which is possible only when \(T=1110 \mathrm{~K}\).
\(\therefore \quad \Delta G=170 \times 10^{3}-(1110 \times 170)=-18700 \mathrm{~J}\)
Thus, reaction is spontaneous at \(T=1110 \mathrm{~K}\).
66. (d) : Gas phase reaction,
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{PCl}_{5(g)} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{PCl}_{3(g)}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2(g)} \\
& \Delta H=\Delta E+\Delta n_{g} R T
\end{aligned}
\]
\(\Delta n_{g}=\) Change in number of moles of products and reactants species.
Since \(\Delta n_{g}=+\mathrm{ve}\), hence \(\Delta H=+\mathrm{ve}\)
also one mole of \(\mathrm{PCl}_{5}\) is dissociated into two moles of \(\mathrm{PCl}_{3}\) and \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\) in the same phase.
Therefore, \(\Delta S=S_{\text {products }}-S_{\text {reactants }}\)
\[
\Delta S=+\mathrm{ve} .
\]
67. (c) : The criteria for spontaneity of a process in terms of \(\Delta G\) is as follows :
- If \(\Delta G\) is negative, the process is spontaneous.
- If \(\Delta G\) is positive, the process does not occur in the forward direction. It may occur in the backward direction.
- If \(\Delta G\) is zero, the system is in equilibrium.
68. (b) : \(\mathrm{Br}_{2(l)}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{BrCl}_{(g)}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta H=30 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}, \Delta S=105 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\
& \Delta S=\frac{\Delta H}{T} \text { i.e. } 105=\frac{30}{T} \times 1000 \\
\therefore & T=\frac{30 \times 1000}{105}=285.7 \mathrm{~K}
\end{aligned}
\]
69. (a) : For spontaneous reaction, \(\Delta H=-\mathrm{ve}, \Delta S=+\mathrm{ve}\).

Spontaneity depends upon both critical minimum energy and maximum randomness disorderness.
70. (c) : \(\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S\)
\(\Delta G=-\) ve for spontaneous reaction.
When \(\Delta S=+\mathrm{ve}, \Delta H=+\mathrm{ve}\) and \(T \Delta S>\Delta H \Rightarrow \Delta G=-\mathrm{ve}\)
71. (b) : \(\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& =-382.64-298\left(\frac{-145.6}{1000}\right) \\
& =-382.64+43.38=-339.3 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
\]
72. (a) : For spontaneous process, \(\Delta S_{\text {total }}>0\).
\(\therefore \quad \Delta S_{\text {sys }}+\Delta S_{\text {surr }}>0\)
73. (d) \(: S=\frac{q_{\text {rev }}}{T}=\frac{6000}{273}=21.978 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
74. (a) : \(\Delta G^{\circ}=-P \Delta V=\) Work done
\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta V & =\left(\frac{12}{3.31}-\frac{12}{2.25}\right) \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~L}=-1.71 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~L} \\
\Delta G^{\circ} & =\text { Work done }=-\left(-1.71 \times 10^{-3}\right) \times P \times 101.3 \mathrm{~J} \\
P & =\frac{1895}{1.71 \times 10^{-3} \times 101.3}=10.93 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~atm} \\
& =11.08 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~Pa} \approx 9.92 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~Pa} \quad(\because 1 \mathrm{~atm}=101325 \mathrm{~Pa})
\end{aligned}
\]
75. (a) : Entropy change \((\Delta S)\) is given by \(\Delta S=\frac{q_{\text {rev }}}{T}\)
∴ \(\quad\) Unit of entropy \(=\mathrm{JK}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
76. (d) : The change of entropy \(d S=\frac{q_{\text {rev }}}{T}\)

From the first law of thermodynamics,
\(d q=d U+P d V=C_{V} d T+P d V\)
\(\Rightarrow \frac{d q}{T}=C_{V} \frac{d T}{T}+\frac{P}{T} d V\)
\(\Rightarrow \frac{d q}{T}=C_{V} \frac{d T}{T}+\frac{R d V}{V}\left[\right.\) For 1 mole of a gas, \(\left.\frac{P}{T}=\frac{R}{V}\right]\)
\(\therefore \quad d S=C_{V} \frac{d T}{T}+R \frac{d V}{V}\)
\(\Rightarrow \Delta S=C_{V} \ln \frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}+R \ln \frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}} \quad\) [for one mole of ideal gas]
Here \(T_{2}=T_{1}=27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=300 \mathrm{~K} \quad \therefore \quad \ln \frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}=0\)
\(\therefore \quad \Delta S=R \ln \frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}=2 \ln \frac{20}{2}=2 \ln 10=4.605\)
\(\therefore \quad \Delta S=4.605 \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{K}\)
Entropy change for 2 moles of gas
\[
=2 \times 4.605 \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{K}=9.2 \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{K}
\]
77. (d) : The sign and magnitude of Gibbs free energy is a criterion of spontaneity for a process.
When \(\Delta G>0\) or +ve, it means \(G_{\text {products }}>G_{\text {reactants }}\)
as \(\Delta G=G_{\text {products }}-G_{\text {reactants }}\)
the reaction will not take place spontaneously, i.e. the reaction should be spontaneous in reverse direction.
```
+4 +2
\(\mathrm{SnO}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{SnO} ; \Delta \mathrm{G}>0\)
(more
favourable)
```

\(\Delta G<0\) or -ve, the reaction or change occurs spontaneously.
\[
\stackrel{+4}{\mathrm{PbO}_{2}} \rightarrow \underset{\substack{\text { (more } \\ \text { favourable) }}}{\stackrel{+2}{\mathrm{PbO}} ; \Delta G<0}
\]
78. (a) : For a cell reaction to be spontaneous, \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) should be negative. As \(\Delta G^{\circ}=-n F E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}\), so the value will be -ve only when \(E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}\) is + ve.
79. (c) : The entropy of a substance increases with increase in temperature. However at absolute zero the entropy of a perfectly crystalline substance is taken as zero, which is also called as third law of thermodynamics.
80. (d) : (i) The given reaction is a combustion reaction, therefore \(\Delta H\) is less than 0 . Hence, \(\Delta H\) is negative.
(ii) Since there is increase in the number of moles of gaseous products, therefore \(\Delta S\) is positive.
(iii) Since reaction is spontaneous, therefore \(\Delta G\) is negative.

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (a) : Vapour pressure is directly related to temperature. Greater is the temperature, greater will be the vapour pressure. So to keep it constant, temperature should be constant.
\(\begin{array}{lc}\text { 2. (a) : } 3 \mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{O}_{3(g)} \\ \text { Initial conc. 1 } & 0 \\ \text { At equilibrium } 1-3 x & 2 x\end{array}\)
\[
K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{O}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]^{3}}=3 \times 10^{-59}
\]

Given : \(\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]=0.040 \mathrm{M}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{O}_{3}\right]^{2}}{(0.040)^{3}}=3 \times 10^{-59} \\
& {\left[\mathrm{O}_{3}\right]^{2}=1.92 \times 10^{-63}} \\
& {\left[\mathrm{O}_{3}\right]=4.38 \times 10^{-32} \mathrm{M}}
\end{aligned}
\]
3. (a) : From the given equations,
\[
2 \mathrm{NH}_{3} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{~N}_{2}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} ; \frac{1}{K_{1}}
\]
\[
\mathrm{N}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO} ; \mathrm{K}_{2}
\]
\(3 \mathrm{H}_{2}+\frac{3}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightleftharpoons 3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} ; \mathrm{K}_{3}^{3}\)

By adding equations (i), (ii) and (iii), we get
\(2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}+\frac{5}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \xlongequal{K} 2 \mathrm{NO}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, K=\frac{K_{2} K_{3}^{3}}{K_{1}}\)
4. (d) : If the reaction is multiplied by \(\frac{1}{2}\), then new equilibrium constant, \(K^{\prime}=K^{1 / 2}\).
5. (c) : \(2 \mathrm{SO}_{2(g)}+\mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{SO}_{3(g)}, \mathrm{K}=278\)

By reversing the equation (i), we get
\[
2 \mathrm{SO}_{3(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{SO}_{2(g)}+\mathrm{O}_{2(g)}
\]

Equilibrium constant for this reaction is,
\[
K^{\prime}=\frac{1}{K}=\frac{1}{278}
\]

By dividing the equation (ii) by 2 , we get desired equation,
\[
\mathrm{SO}_{3(g)} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{SO}_{2(g)}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2(g)}
\]

Equilibrium constant for this reaction,
\(K^{\prime \prime}=\sqrt{K^{\prime}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{K}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{278}}=0.0599 \approx 0.06\) or \(6 \times 10^{-2}\)
6. (c) : \(A_{2(g)}+B_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2 A B_{(g)}\)
\(K_{c}=\frac{[A B]^{2}}{\left[A_{2}\right]\left[B_{2}\right]}=\frac{\left(2.8 \times 10^{-3}\right)^{2}}{\left(3.0 \times 10^{-3}\right)\left(4.2 \times 10^{-3}\right)}=\frac{2.8 \times 2.8}{3.0 \times 4.2}=0.62\)
7. (c) : \(\mathrm{N}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO} ; \mathrm{K}_{1}\)
\(2 \mathrm{NO}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}_{2} ; \mathrm{K}_{2}\)
\(\mathrm{NO}_{2} \rightleftharpoons \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~N}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2} ; \mathrm{K}\)
\(K_{1}=\frac{[\mathrm{NO}]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]} ; K_{2}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]^{2}}{[\mathrm{NO}]^{2}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}\)
\(K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]^{1 / 2}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]}=\sqrt{\frac{\left.\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right] \times\left[\mathrm{NO}^{2}\right]^{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}{[\mathrm{NO}]^{2} \times\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]^{2}}} \Rightarrow K=\sqrt{\frac{1}{K_{1} K_{2}}}\)
8. (c) : Given, \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}\)
\(K_{1}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\right]}=1.5 \times 10^{-5}\)
\(\mathrm{HCN} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{CN}^{-}\)
\(K_{2}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CN}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]}{[\mathrm{HCN}]}=4.5 \times 10^{-10}\)
\(\mathrm{CN}^{-}+\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HCN}+\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}\)
\(K=\frac{[\mathrm{HCN}]\left[\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CN}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\right]}\)
\(K=\frac{K_{1}}{K_{2}}=\frac{1.5 \times 10^{-5}}{4.5 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 0.3 \times 10^{5}\) or \(K=3 \times 10^{4}\)
9. (d) : \(\mathrm{HI}_{(g)} \rightleftharpoons 1 / 2 \mathrm{H}_{2(g)}+1 / 2 \mathrm{I}_{2(g)}\)
i.e. \(K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{1 / 2}\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]^{1 / 2}}{[\mathrm{HI}]}=8\)
\(\mathrm{H}_{2(g)}+\mathrm{I}_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{HI}_{(g)}\)
\(K^{\prime}=\frac{[\mathrm{HI}]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]}=\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{2} \Rightarrow K^{\prime}=\frac{1}{64}\)
10. (a) : \(K_{1}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{NO}_{2}}}{P_{\mathrm{NO}} \cdot\left(P_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)^{1 / 2}}\)
\(K_{2}=\frac{\left(p_{\mathrm{NO}}\right)^{2} \cdot p_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\left(p_{\mathrm{NO}_{2}}\right)^{2}}\)

Taking square root on both sides in eq. 2,
\(\Rightarrow \sqrt{K_{2}}=\frac{p_{\mathrm{NO}} \cdot\left(p_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)^{1 / 2}}{p_{\mathrm{NO}_{2}}} \Rightarrow \sqrt{K_{2}}=\frac{1}{K_{1}} \Rightarrow K_{2}=\frac{1}{K_{1}^{2}}\)
11. (d) : Given,
\(\mathrm{XeF}_{6}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{XeOF}_{4}+2 \mathrm{HF}, K_{\text {eq }}=K_{1}\)
\(\mathrm{XeOF}_{4}+2 \mathrm{HF} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{XeF}_{6}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, K_{\text {eq }}=1 / K_{1}\)
and \(\mathrm{XeO}_{4}+\mathrm{XeF}_{6} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{XeOF}_{4}+\mathrm{XeO}_{3} \mathrm{~F}_{2}, K_{\text {eq }}=K\)

The reaction, \(\mathrm{XeO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{HF} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{XeO}_{3} \mathrm{~F}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\), can be obtained by adding eq. (1) and eq.(2).
So, the equilibrium constant for the above reaction can be obtained by multiplying the equilibrium constants of eq. (1) and eq. (2).
Hence, the value is \(\frac{K_{2}}{K_{1}}\).
12. (c) : The equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction will be \(1 / K\).
13. (a) : Reaction (ii) is the reversible reaction of (i) and is half of the reaction (i). Thus, rate constant can be given as :
\(K_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{K_{1}}}\) or \(K_{1}=\left(\frac{1}{K_{2}}\right)^{2}\)
14. (a) : \(K_{p}=K_{c}(R T)^{\Delta n_{g}}\)

When \(\Delta n_{g} \neq 0, K_{p} \neq K_{C}\)
For option (a) \(\Delta n_{g}=2-1=1 \neq 0\)
Thus, \(K_{p} \neq K_{c}\)

Equilibrium constant, \(K=\frac{[C]^{3}[D]}{[A]^{2}[B]}=\frac{(0.75)^{3}(0.25)}{(0.5)^{2}(0.75)}\)
16. (d) : \(2 A B_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2 A B_{(g)}+B_{2(g)}\)

\]

Amount of moles at equilibrium \(=2(1-x)+2 x+x=2+x\)
\(K_{p}=\frac{\left[p_{A B}\right]^{2}\left[p_{B_{2}}\right]}{\left[p_{A B_{2}}\right]^{2}}\)
\(K_{p}=\frac{\left(\frac{2 x}{2+x} \times P\right)^{2} \times\left(\frac{x}{2+x} \times P\right)}{\left(\frac{2(1-x)}{2+x} \times P\right)^{2}}=\frac{\frac{4 x^{3}}{2+x} \times P}{4(1-x)^{2}}\)
\[
\begin{gathered}
K_{p}=\frac{4 x^{3} \times P}{2} \times \frac{1}{4} \quad(\because 1-x \approx 1 \text { and } 2+x \approx 2) \\
x=\left(\frac{8 K_{p}}{4 P}\right)^{1 / 3} \Rightarrow x=\left(\frac{2 K_{p}}{P}\right)^{1 / 3}
\end{gathered}
\]

\begin{tabular}{lcccc} 
17. (a) : & \(X\) & \(\rightleftharpoons\) & \(Y\) \\
Initially & 1 & & 0 & 0 \\
At equilibrium & \(1-\alpha\) & & \(\alpha\) & \(\alpha\)
\end{tabular}

Total no. of moles at equilibrium \(=1-\alpha+2 \alpha=1+\alpha\) Similarly,

\begin{tabular}{lll} 
& \(A \rightleftharpoons\) & \(2 B\) \\
Initially & 1 & \\
At equilibrium & \(1-\alpha\) & \\
& \(2 \alpha\)
\end{tabular}

Total no. of moles at equilibrium \(=1-\alpha+2 \alpha=1+\alpha\)
\(\therefore K_{p_{1}}=\frac{p_{Y} \times p_{Z}}{p_{X}}=\frac{\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha} \times P_{1} \times \frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha} \times P_{1}}{\frac{1-\alpha}{1+\alpha} \times P_{1}}=\frac{\alpha^{2} P_{1}}{(1+\alpha)(1-\alpha)}\)
\(K_{p_{2}}=\frac{\left(p_{B}\right)^{2}}{p_{A}}=\frac{\left(\frac{2 \alpha}{1+\alpha} \times p_{2}\right)^{2}}{\frac{1-\alpha}{1+\alpha} \times p_{2}}=\frac{(2 \alpha)^{2} p_{2}}{(1+\alpha)(1-\alpha)}\)
Now \(\frac{K_{p_{1}}}{K_{p_{2}}}=\frac{P_{1}}{4 P_{2}} \Rightarrow \frac{K_{p_{1}}}{K_{p_{2}}}=\frac{9}{1}=\frac{P_{1}}{4 P_{2}} \Rightarrow \frac{P_{1}}{P_{2}}=\frac{36}{1}=36: 1\)
18. (c) : For the reaction,
\(2 A \rightleftharpoons B+C ; K_{C}=4 \times 10^{-3}\)
\(Q_{C}=\frac{[B][C]}{[A]^{2}}=\frac{2 \times 10^{-3} \times 2 \times 10^{-3}}{\left[2 \times 10^{-3}\right]^{2}}=1\)
Since, \(Q_{C}>K_{C}\) hence, the reaction will proceed in the direction of reactants (i.e., backward direction).
19. (d) : \(\underset{0.1}{2 \mathrm{NO}_{(g)}} \rightleftharpoons \underset{0}{\stackrel{\mathrm{~N}}{2(g)}+}+\underset{0}{\mathrm{O}_{2(g)}}\)
\(K_{c}=\frac{\frac{x}{2} \times \frac{x}{2}}{(0.1-x)^{2}}\)
Again \(K_{c}==\frac{\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}{[\mathrm{NO}]^{2}}=\frac{3 \times 10^{-3} \times 4.2 \times 10^{-3}}{\left(2.8 \times 10^{-3}\right)^{2}}=1.607\)
\(\Rightarrow \frac{x^{2}}{4(0.1-x)^{2}}=1.607 \Rightarrow \frac{x}{2(0.1-x)}=\sqrt{1.607}\)
\(\Rightarrow \frac{x}{0.2-2 x}=1.26 \Rightarrow x=0.252-2.52 x\)
\(\Rightarrow \quad 3.52 x=0.252 \Rightarrow x=\frac{0.252}{3.52}=0.0716\)
Degree of dissociation, \(\alpha=\frac{0.0716}{0.1}=0.716\)
20. (d) : \(\mathrm{SrCO}_{3(s)} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{SrO}_{(s)}+\mathrm{CO}_{2(g)} ; K_{p}=1.6 \mathrm{~atm}\)
\(K_{p}=\frac{p_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \times p_{\mathrm{SrO}}}{p_{\mathrm{SrCO}_{3}}} \Rightarrow 1.6=p_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \quad\left(\because p_{\mathrm{SrO}}=p_{\mathrm{SrCO}_{3}}=1\right)\)
∴ \(\quad\) Maximum pressure of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}=1.6 \mathrm{~atm}\)
Let the maximum volume of the container when pressure of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) is 1.6 atm be \(V \mathrm{~L}\)
During the process, \(P V=\) constant
\(\therefore \quad 0.4 \times 20=1.6 \times V \Rightarrow V=\frac{0.4 \times 20}{1.6}=5 \mathrm{~L}\)
21. (d) : \(K_{p}\) and \(K_{c}\) are related by the equation,
\(K_{p}=K_{c}(R T)^{\Delta n_{g}}\)
where \(\Delta n_{g}=\) difference in the no. of moles of products and reactants in the gaseous state.
for \(2 \mathrm{C}_{(s)}+\mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2(g)}\)
\(\Delta n_{g}=2-1=1 \neq 0\)
22. (a) : \(\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3(s)} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}_{(a q)}^{3+}+3 \mathrm{OH}_{(a q)}^{-}\)
\(K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]^{3}}{\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}\right]}\)
\(K=\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]^{3} \quad(\because\) activity of solid is taken unity)
Concentration of \(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)ion in the reaction is decreased by \(1 / 4\) times then equilibrium concentration of \(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\) will be increased by 64 times in order to keep the value of \(K\) constant.
23. (a) : \(K_{p}=p_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\)

Solids do not exert pressure, so their partial pressure is taken as unity.
24. (a) : The value of \(K\) is high which means reaction proceeds almost to completion i.e., the system will contain mostly products.
25. (b): \(\underset{3}{3 \mathrm{H}_{2}}+\underset{1}{\mathrm{~N}_{2}} \rightarrow \underset{2}{2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}}\)
\(\begin{array}{lll}3 / 2 & 1 / 2 & 1\end{array}\)
\(10 \times \frac{3}{2} \quad 10 \times \frac{1}{2} \quad 10 \times 1\)
15510
Composition of gaseous mixture under the aforesaid condition in the end will be
\(\mathrm{H}_{2}=30-15=15\) litres
\(\mathrm{N}_{2}=30-5=25\) litres; \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}=10\) litres
26. (c) : \(\mathrm{N}_{2(g)}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3(g)}\)
\(K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{3}} ; \Delta n_{g}=2-4=-2\)
Thus, the reaction will go from right to left when \(Q>K_{c}\).
27. (a) : \(A+B \rightleftharpoons C+D\)
\(K=\frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}=\frac{10 \times 6}{2 \times 3}=10\)
\(\Delta G^{\circ}=-R T \ln K\)
\(\Delta G^{\circ}=-2.303 R T \log K\)
\(\Delta G^{\circ}=-2.303 \times 2 \times 300 \times \log 10\)
\[
=-2.303 \times 2 \times 300=-1381.80 \mathrm{cal}
\]
28. (a) : \(\Delta G=\Delta G^{\circ}+R T \ln Q\)

At equilibrium, \(\Delta G=0\) and \(Q=K_{C}\)
\(\therefore \quad 0=\Delta G^{\circ}+R T \ln K_{C}\)
\(\Rightarrow \quad \Delta G^{\circ}=-R T \ln K_{C}\)
\[
=-8.314 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \times 300 \mathrm{~K} \times \ln \left(2 \times 10^{13}\right)
\]
29. (a)
30. (c): When \(K_{p}>Q\), rate of forward reaction \(>\) rate of backward reaction.
\(\therefore \quad\) Reaction is spontaneous.
When \(\Delta G^{\circ}<R T \ln Q, \Delta G^{\circ}\) is positive, reverse reaction is feasible, thus reaction is non spontaneous.
When \(K_{p}=Q\), rate of forward reaction = rate of backward reaction.
∴ Reaction is in equilibrium.
When \(T \Delta S>\Delta H, \Delta G\) will be negative only when \(\Delta H=+v e\).
\(\therefore \quad\) Reaction is spontaneous and endothermic.
31. (a) : On increasing the pressure and decreasing the temperature, equilibrium will shift in forward direction.
32. (d) : As the forward reaction is exothermic and leads to lowering of pressure (produces lesser number of gaseous moles) hence, according to Le Chatelier's principle, at high pressure and low temperature, the given reversible reaction will shift in forward direction to form more product.
33. (a) \(: \log \frac{K_{p}^{\prime}}{K_{p}}=-\frac{\Delta H}{2.303 R}\left[\frac{1}{T_{2}}-\frac{1}{T_{1}}\right]\)

For exothermic reaction, \(\Delta H=-\) ve i.e., heat is evolved. The temperature \(T_{2}\) is higher than \(T_{1}\).
Thus, \(\left(\frac{1}{T_{2}}-\frac{1}{T_{1}}\right)\) is negative.
so, \(\log K_{p}^{\prime}-\log K_{p}=-\) ve \(\quad\) or \(\quad \log K_{p}>\log K_{p}^{\prime}\)
or \(K_{p}>K_{p}^{\prime}\)
34. (a) : HCl and \(\mathrm{SO}_{2}\) are reducing agents. So, they can reduce \(\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}\).
\(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) is neither oxidising nor reducing agent, it will provide only acidic medium. It can shift the reaction in forward direction and the reaction can go to completion.
35. (d) : \(X_{2(g)}+4 Y_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2 X Y_{4(g)}\)
\(\Delta n_{g}=-\mathrm{ve}\) and \(\Delta H=-\mathrm{ve}\)
The reaction is favoured in forward direction at low temperature and high pressure.
36. (c) : \(\mathrm{CH}_{4(g)}+2 \mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}_{2(g)}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)}\)
\(K_{p}=\frac{p_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{p_{\mathrm{CH}_{4}} \cdot p_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}^{2}}\)
37. (c) : Pressure of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) does not depend on concentration terms of other reactants (because both are in solid state). Since this is an endothermic reaction, if the temperature is raised, dissociation of \(\mathrm{BaO}_{2}\) would occur, more \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) is produced at equilibrium, pressure of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) increases.
38. (b) : For a reaction, \(A+B \rightleftharpoons C+D\),
\(K_{\text {eq }}=\frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}\)
Increase in conc. of reactants will proceed the equilibrium in the forward direction giving more products so that the equilibrium constant value remains constant and independent of concentration.
39. (d) : When solid and liquid are in equilibrium, the increase in temperature results in increase in volume of liquid or decrease in the amount of solid.

Solid ⇌ Liquid
With increase in temperature equilibrium shifts in forward direction.
40. (d) : According to Le Chatelier's principle, if an equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, pressure or temperature, etc. equilibrium shift in such a way so as to undo the effect of a change imposed.
41. (a) : HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely into ions in aqueous solution.
42. (b) : \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\)

As acetic acid is a weak acid so, it also contains some undissociated \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\) along with \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}\)and \(\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\)ions.
43. (a) : Among the given molecules/ion, \(\mathrm{BF}_{3}\) acts as a Lewis acid as it is an electron deficient species, it can accept a lone pair of electrons.
44. (d) : Bronsted acid Conjugate base
\(\begin{array}{ll}\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \mathrm{OH}^{-} \\ \mathrm{HF} & \mathrm{F}^{-}\end{array}\)
45. (c) : HCl cannot accept \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ion, therefore cannot act as . Bronsted Base.
46. (b) : \(\mathrm{BF}_{3} \longrightarrow\) Lewis acid (incomplete octet)
\(\mathrm{PF}_{3} \longrightarrow\) Lewis base (presence of lone pair on P atom)
\(\mathrm{CF}_{4} \longrightarrow\) Complete octet
\(\mathrm{SiF}_{4} \longrightarrow\) Lewis acid (empty \(d\)-orbital in Si-atom)
47. (a) : \(\mathrm{BF}_{3}\) is Lewis acid ( \(e^{-}\)pair acceptor).
48. (a) : \(\stackrel{+7}{+7} \mathrm{ClO}_{4}\) with highest oxidation number and its conjugate base is resonance stabilised, hence it is most acidic.
Cl is more electronegative than S .
49. (c) : Compounds that are electron deficient act as Lewis acids. Out of the given hydrides \(\mathrm{B}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}\) satisfies this condition and is therefore a Lewis acid.
50. (d) : Lewis acids are electron deficient compounds, since \(\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{~B}\) is electron deficient (due to incomplete octet of B ), it acts as a Lewis acid.
51. (d) : Due to strong hydrogen-fluorine bond, proton is not given off easily and hence, HF is weakest acid.
52. (a) : \(\mathrm{B}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}\) in aqueous medium coordinates a molecule of water to form the hydrated species
<smiles>[O]=[BiH2][OH]</smiles>

In this species, \(B^{3+}\) ion, because of its small size, has high polarizing power thereby pulling the sigma electron charge of the coordinated O atom towards itself. The coordinated oxygen, in turn, pulls the sigma electron charge of the OH bond of the attached water molecule towards itself. This facilitates the removal of \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ion from the \(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{H}\) bond.

Thus, the solution of \(\mathrm{B}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}\) in water acts as a weak acid, and it is not a protonic acid.
53. (c) : Proton accepting tendency is known as the strength of basicity.
In \(\mathrm{R}-\dot{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{~N}\) has lone pair of electrons which intensify due to electron releasing \(R\)-group and increase the tendency to donate lone pair of electrons to \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\).

Secondly as the size of the ion increases there is less attraction for \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)to form bond with H -atom and are less basic. Thus the order of proton accepting tendency:
\(R \mathrm{NH}_{2}>\mathrm{NH}_{3}>\mathrm{HS}^{-}>\mathrm{I}^{-}\).
54. (d) : \(\mathrm{NH}_{2}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{NH}_{3}\) (conjugate acid)

Substance \(+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow\) conjugate acid
Substance \(-\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow\) conjugate base
55. (b) : In \(\mathrm{BCl}_{3}\) the central atom ' B ' is \(s p^{2}\) hybridised and contains only 'six' electrons in its valence shell. Therefore, it is electron deficient.
56. (d) : \(\underset{\text { Weak acid }}{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}} \rightleftharpoons \underset{\text { Strong conjugate base }}{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}}+\mathrm{H}^{+}\)

As \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\) is the weakest acid, so its conjugate base \(\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}\right)\)is the strongest base. \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}, \mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{HNO}_{3}\) are strong acids, so their conjugate bases are weak.
57. (b) : In \(\mathrm{BF}_{3}\) and \(\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}\) molecules, the central atoms have incomplete octet and in \(\mathrm{SiF}_{4}\), the central atom has empty \(d\)-orbitals. Hence, according to Lewis concept, these are Lewis acids.
58. (a) : Ammonium sulphate is a salt of strong acid \(\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)\) and weak base \(\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}\right)\). Therefore, repeated use of ammonium sulphate would increase the concentration of sulphuric acid, while ammonia from \(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}\) is used up by the plant. Hence, the acidity of soil will increase.
59. (c) : \(K_{a}=C \alpha^{2}\)
\(K_{a}=(0.1) \times(0.01)^{2}=1 \times 10^{-5}\)
60. (d) : For a salt of weak acid and weak base
\[
\mathrm{pH}=7+\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathrm{p} K_{a}-\mathrm{p} K_{b}\right)
\]

Given, \(\mathrm{p} K_{a}=4.77, \mathrm{p} K_{b}=3.27\)
\[
\mathrm{pH}=7+\frac{1}{2}(4.77-3.27)=7.75
\]
61. (a) : \(\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ni}_{s}^{2+}+\underset{2 s}{2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}}\)
where \(s\) is the solubility of \(\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\).
\(\underset{0.1 \mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{NaOH}} \rightleftharpoons \underset{0.1 \mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}+\underset{0.1 \mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{OH}^{-}}\)
\(\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=2 s+0.1 \approx 0.1(\because 2 s \lll 0.1)\)
Ionic product of \(\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}=\left[\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]^{2}\)
\(2 \times 10^{-15}=s(0.1)^{2}\)
\(s=\frac{2 \times 10^{-15}}{0.1 \times 0.1}=2 \times 10^{-13} \mathrm{M}\)
62. (c) : \(\mathrm{NaOH} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)
\(0.01 \mathrm{M} \quad 0.01 \mathrm{M}\)
\(\therefore \quad\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=0.01 \mathrm{M}\)
\(\therefore \quad \mathrm{pOH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=-\log (0.01)=2\)
\(\therefore \mathrm{pH}=14-\mathrm{pOH}=14-2=12\)
63. (d) : \(\mathrm{pH}=1\), so \(\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=10^{-1}\)

For acid base mixture: \(N_{1} V_{1}-N_{2} V_{2}=N_{3} V_{3}\)
(For NaOH and HCl , Normality = Molarity)
A. \(M_{1}\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)=\frac{60 \times \frac{1}{10}-40 \times \frac{1}{10}}{100}=2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{M}\)
i.e. \(\mathrm{pH}=1.698 \approx 1.7\)
B. \(M_{2}\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)=\frac{55 \times \frac{1}{10}-45 \times \frac{1}{10}}{100}=\frac{1}{100}=10^{-2} \mathrm{M}\) i.e. \(\mathrm{pH}=2\)
C. \(\mathrm{M}_{3}\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)=\frac{75 \times \frac{1}{5}-25 \times \frac{1}{5}}{100}=10^{-1} \mathrm{Mi.e} \mathrm{pH}=\).
D. \(M_{4}\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)=\frac{100 \times \frac{1}{10}-100 \times \frac{1}{10}}{200}=0\) i.e. \(\mathrm{pH}=7\)
64. (b) : \(\underset{0.10 \mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{~N}}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{5} \stackrel{+}{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{H}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)
\(\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{K_{b}}{C}}=\sqrt{\frac{1.7 \times 10^{-9}}{0.10}}=1.30 \times 10^{-4}\)
∴ Percentage of pyridine that forms pyridinium ion
\(=1.30 \times 10^{-4} \times 100=0.013 \%\)
65. (d) : One mole of NaOH is completely neutralised by one mole of HCl .
Hence, 0.01 mole of NaOH will be completely neutralised by 0.01 mole of HCl .
\(\Rightarrow \quad \mathrm{NaOH}\) left unneutralised \(=0.1-0.01=0.09 \mathrm{~mol}\)
As equal volumes of two solutions are mixed,
\([\mathrm{OH}]^{-}=\frac{0.09}{2}=0.045 \mathrm{M}\)
\(\Rightarrow \mathrm{pOH}=-\log (0.045)=1.35 \therefore \mathrm{pH}=14-1.35=12.65\)
66. (c) : \(\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\) which is a salt of NaOH (strong base) and \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\) (weak acid) will produce a basic solution with pH greater than 7 .
67. (b) : Degree of dissociation, \(\alpha=\frac{3.7}{100}=0.037\)

According to Ostwald's formula,
\(K_{a}=\alpha^{2} C=(0.037)^{2} \times 0.10=1.369 \times 10^{-4} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-4}\)
68. (d) : We know that, at \(25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, K_{w}=1 \times 10^{-14}\)

At \(100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, K_{w}=55 \times 10^{-14} \quad\left[\because K_{w}=\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]\right.\)
\(\Rightarrow K_{w}=\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2}\)
\(\mathrm{H}^{+}=\sqrt{K_{w}}\)
\(\mathrm{H}^{+}=\sqrt{55 \times 10^{-14}} \Rightarrow \mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\)
\(\mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\sqrt{55 \times 10^{-14}}\right]\)
\(=\frac{1}{2}\left[-\log \left(55 \times 10^{-14}\right)\right]=\frac{1}{2}[-\log 55+14 \log 10]\)
\(=\frac{1}{2}[-1.74+14]=\frac{1}{2}[12.26]=6.13\)
69. (a) : \(\mathrm{BaCl}_{2}\) is made up of \(\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\) and HCl .
\(\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}\) is made up of \(\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}\) and HCl .
LiCl is made up of LiOH and HCl .
\(\mathrm{BeCl}_{2}\) is made up of \(\mathrm{Be}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\) and HCl .
\(\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\) is strongest base among the given options thus have maximum pH .

\]
71. (d) : \(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}\) is a salt of strong acid and weak base, so hydrolysis constant is
\[
K_{h}=\frac{K_{w}}{K_{b}}
\]

Given, \(K_{b}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}\right)=1.77 \times 10^{-5}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
K_{w} & =10^{-14} \\
\therefore \quad K_{h} & =\frac{10^{-14}}{1.77 \times 10^{-5}}=0.565 \times 10^{-9} \text { or } K_{h}=5.65 \times 10^{-10}
\end{aligned}
\]
72. (d) : Millimoles of \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)produced \(=20 \times 0.05=1\)

Millimoles of \(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)produced \(=30 \times 0.1 \times 2=6\)
( \(\because\) Each \(\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\) gives \(2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}\).)
∴ Millimoles of \(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)remaining in solution \(=6-1=5\)
Total volume of solution \(=20+30=50 \mathrm{~mL}\)
\(\therefore\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=\frac{5}{50}=0.1 \mathrm{M}\)
73. (d) : \(\mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\)
or \(\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=10^{-\mathrm{pH}} ;\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\)of soln. \(1=10^{-3}\)
\(\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\)of soln. \(2=10^{-4} ;\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\)of soln. \(3=10^{-5}\)
Total concentration of \(\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=10^{-3}\left(1+1 \times 10^{-1}+1 \times 10^{-2}\right)\)
\(\Rightarrow 10^{-3}\left(\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{100}\right) \Rightarrow 10^{-3}\left(\frac{100+10+1}{100}\right)\)
\(\Rightarrow 10^{-3}\left(\frac{111}{100}\right)=1.11 \times 10^{-3}\)
So, \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ion concentration in mixture of equal volumes of these acid solution \(=\frac{1.11 \times 10^{-3}}{3}=3.7 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}\)
74. (a) : For a weak acid, degree of dissociation,

75. (a) : Given, \(\left[\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\right]=1 \times 10^{-10}\) or, \(\mathrm{pH}=10\)

Now at \(25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{pH}+\mathrm{pOH}=\mathrm{p} K_{w}=14\)
or, \(\mathrm{pOH}=14-\mathrm{pH}=14-10=4\)
76. (c) : \(10^{-8} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HCl}=10^{-8} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}^{+}\)

Also from water, \(\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=10^{-7}\)
Total \(\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=10^{-7}+0.10 \times 10^{-7}=1.1 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}\)

\]
78. (b) : \(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}\) is a weak base but HCl is a strong acid in solution, so pH of \(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}\) solution is comparatively low.
\(\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}\) is a salt of strong base and strong acid, so pH of the solution will be 7 .
Hydrolysis of potassium acetate (a salt of a weak acid and a strong alkali) gives a weakly alkaline solution, since the acetate ion acts as a weak base.
\(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOK}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}+\mathrm{K}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)
The pH of this solution \(\approx 8.8\).
Hydrolysis of sodium carbonate (a salt of strong alkali and a weak acid) gives an alkaline solution.
\(\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow 2\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\)
The pH of this solution is \(>10\).
79. (d) : \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}\)
\(K_{a}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\right]}\)
\(\left[\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\right]=\frac{3.4 \times 10^{-4} \times 3.4 \times 10^{-4}}{1.7 \times 10^{-5}}=6.8 \times 10^{-3}\)
80. (b) : (i) \(\mathrm{H}_{2} A \xlongequal{K_{a_{1}}} H A^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}\)
(ii) \(\mathrm{HA}^{-} \xlongequal{K_{a_{2}}} A^{2-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}\)

In the \(1^{\text {st }}\) step, \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ion comes from neutral molecule, while in the \(2^{\text {nd }}\) step the \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ion comes from negatively charged ions. The presence of -ve charge makes the removal of \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ion difficult. Thus, \(K_{a_{1}}>K_{a_{2}}\).
81. (b) : After mixing 1 N solution of \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\) (weak acid) and 1 N NaOH (strong base), the resulting solution will have free \(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)ions. Thus, pH will be higher than 7.
82. (a) : \(\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=\mathrm{C} \alpha=0.1 \times 0.02=2 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}\)
(As degree of dissociation \(=2 \%=0.02\) )
Hence, \(\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=\frac{10^{-14}}{2 \times 10^{-3}}=5 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{M}\)
83. (c) : \(\mathrm{NaH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{NaOH}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\)
or, \(\mathrm{H}_{(a q)}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)} \rightarrow \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \uparrow\)

Total number of moles \(=2(1-\alpha)+2 \alpha=2\)
86. (b) : Since NaOH is a strong base, therefore it completely ionises. Thus, the hydroxyl ion concentration is equal to that of the base itself. We know that concentration of \(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)in \(\mathrm{N} / 10 \mathrm{NaOH}=0.1=10^{-1}\).
Therefore value of
\[
\left[\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\right]=\frac{K_{w}}{\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]}=\frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{10^{-1}}=1 \times 10^{-13}
\]
\(\mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\right]=-\log \left[1 \times 10^{-13}\right]=13\)
87. (c) : Since HCl is a strong acid and it completely ionises, therefore \(\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\)ions concentration is equal that of the acid itself i.e., \(\left[\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\right]=[\mathrm{HCl}]=10 \mathrm{M}\).
Therefore, \(\mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\right]=-\log [10]=-1\)
88. (a) : \(\left[\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\right]=\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=1 \times 10^{-6}\) mole/litre \(K_{w}=\left[\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=\left[1 \times 10^{-6}\right] \times\left[1 \times 10^{-6}\right]=1 \times 10^{-12}\)
89. (a) : Sodium borate is a salt formed from strong base \((\mathrm{NaOH})\) and weak acid \(\left(\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{BO}_{3}\right)\). Hence, sodium borate will act as basic solution.
90. (c) : \(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}\) and \(\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}\) are acidic in nature and NaCl is neutral. Only \(\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\) is basic and thus, have highest pH .
91. (a) : Acidic buffer is prepared by mixing weak acid and its salt with a strong base.
92. (a) : It is an acidic buffer.

For acidic buffer,
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{pH} & =\mathrm{p} K_{a}+\log \frac{[\text { Salt }]}{[\text { Acid }]} \\
& =4.57+\log \frac{0.1}{0.01}=4.57+\log 10=4.57+1=5.57
\end{aligned}
\]
93. (d) : Acid-base titration :
\[
\underset{10 \mathrm{mmol}}{\mathrm{HCl}}+\underset{20 \mathrm{mmol}}{\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}
\]
\(\therefore \quad \mathrm{HCl}\) is the limiting reagent.
Solution contains \(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}\) (weak base) and \(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}\) (salt of strong acid and weak base). Therefore, a basic buffer will be formed.
94. (d) : Acidic buffer is a mixture of a weak acid and its salt with a strong base. \(\mathrm{HClO}_{4}\) is a strong acid.
95. (b) : \(\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K_{a}+\log \frac{\text { [Salt] }}{[\text { Acid }]}\)
\(5=-\log K_{a}+\log \frac{[\text { Salt }]}{[\text { Acid }]}\left[\because \mathrm{p} K_{a}=-\log K_{a}\right]\)
\(5=-\log \left[1 \times 10^{-4}\right]+\log \frac{\text { [Salt] }}{[\text { Acid }]}\)
\(5=4+\log \frac{[\text { Salt }]}{[\text { Acid }]}, 5-4=\log \frac{[\text { Salt }]}{[\text { Acid }]}\)
\(1=\log \frac{[\text { Salt }]}{[\text { Acid }]}, \frac{[\text { Salt }]}{[\text { Acid }]}=10\) i.e. \(10: 1\)
96. (a)
97. (b) : \(\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]=0.30 \mathrm{M}, K_{b}=1.8 \times 10^{-5}\)
\(\left[\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right]=0.20 \mathrm{M}\)
\(p K_{b}=-\log \left(1.8 \times 10^{-5}\right)=4.74\)
\(\mathrm{pOH}=\mathrm{p} K_{b}+\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { base }]}=4.74+\log \frac{0.2}{0.3}=4.56\)
\(\mathrm{pH}=(14-4.56)=9.44\)
98. (d) : We know, \(\mathrm{pOH}=\mathrm{p} K_{b}+\log \frac{\left[B^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{H} B]}\)

Since, \(\left[B^{-}\right]=[\mathrm{HB}]\) (given)
\(\therefore \mathrm{pOH}=\mathrm{p} K_{b} \Rightarrow \mathrm{pOH}=10\)
\(\therefore \mathrm{pH}=14-10=4\)
99. (b) : \(\mathrm{HNO}_{2}\) (weak acid) and \(\mathrm{NaNO}_{2}\) (salt of conjugate base) is an example of acidic buffer.
100. (d) : Let us consider the formation of a salt of a weak acid and a strong base.
\(\mathrm{In}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HIn}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)
\(K_{h}=\frac{[\mathrm{HIn}]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{In}^{-}\right]}\)

Other equations present in the solution are
\(\mathrm{HIn} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{In}^{-}\)
\(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)
\(K_{\mathrm{In}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{In}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HIn}]}\)
\(K_{w}=\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]\)

From (ii) and (iii),
\(\frac{K_{w}}{K_{\mathrm{In}}}=\frac{[\mathrm{HIn}]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{In}^{-}\right]}=K_{h}\)
\(\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=\frac{K_{w}}{K_{\text {In }}} \frac{\left[\mathrm{In}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HIn}]}\)
\(\log \left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=\log K_{w}-\log K_{\mathrm{In}}+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{In}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HIn}]}\)
\(-\mathrm{pOH}=-\mathrm{p} K_{w}+\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{In}}+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{In}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HIn}]}\)
\(\mathrm{p} K_{w}-\mathrm{pOH}=\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{In}}+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{In}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HIn}]}\) or, \(\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{In}}+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{In}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HIn}]}\)
i.e. \(\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{In}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HIn}]}=\mathrm{pH}-\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{In}}\)
101. (b) : Solution of \(0.1 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}\) and \(0.1 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}\) is a buffer solution.
According to Henderson equation, the pH of a basic buffer,
\(\mathrm{pH}=14-\mathrm{p} K_{b}-\log \frac{\text { [Salt] }}{\text { [Base] }} \Rightarrow \mathrm{p} K_{b}=14-\mathrm{pH}-\log \frac{\text { [Salt] }}{\text { [Base] }}\)
\(\Rightarrow \mathrm{p} K_{b}=14-9.25-\log \frac{0.1}{0.1}\)
\(\Rightarrow \mathrm{p} K_{b}=14-9.25=4.75 \therefore \mathrm{p} K_{b}\) of \(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}=4.75\)
102. (b) : pH of an acidic buffer solution is given by Henderson equation :
\(\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K_{a}+\log \frac{\text { [Salt] }}{\text { [Acid] }}\)
Its buffer capacity \(=\mathrm{p} K_{a} \pm 1\)
Since a buffer solution is more effective in pH range \(\mathrm{p} K_{a} \pm 1\) therefore, the weak acid having \(\mathrm{p} K_{a}=3.58\) together with its sodium salt is chosen. Acetoacetic acid is, therefore, the suitable weak acid.
103. (d) : The pH value of the blood is maintained constant by buffer solution present in the blood itself. Buffer solutions resist the change in pH values.
104. (b) : pH of the saturated solution of \(\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}=9\)
\(\therefore \quad \mathrm{pOH}\) of the saturated solution of \(\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}=14-9=5\)
\(\Rightarrow \quad\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=10^{-5}\)
( \(\because \mathrm{pH}+\mathrm{pOH}=14\) )
\(\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \rightleftharpoons \underset{s}{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}+\underset{2 s}{2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}}\)
\(1 / 2 \times 10^{-5} \quad 10^{-5}\)
\(K_{s p}=\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]^{2}=\left[1 / 2 \times 10^{-5}\right]\left[10^{-5}\right]^{2}\)
\(=0.5 \times 10^{-15}\)
105. (c) : \(\mathrm{CaF}_{2} \longrightarrow \underset{s}{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}+\underset{2 s}{2 \mathrm{~F}^{-}}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{NaF} \longrightarrow & \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{F}^{-} \\
& 0.1 \mathrm{M} \quad 0.1 \mathrm{M}
\end{aligned}
\]
\(\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]=s,\left[\mathrm{~F}^{-}\right]=(2 s+0.1) \approx 0.1 \mathrm{M}\)
\(K_{s p}=\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{F}^{-}\right]^{2}\)
\(5.3 \times 10^{-11}=(s)(0.1)^{2}\)
\(s=\frac{5.3 \times 10^{-11}}{(0.1)^{2}}=5.3 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}\)
\(\therefore \quad\) Molar solubility is \(5.3 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}\)
106. (a) : Solubility of \(\mathrm{BaSO}_{4}\),
\(s=\frac{2.42 \times 10^{-3}}{233} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}=1.04 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}\)
\(\mathrm{BaSO}_{4}\) ionizes completely in the solution as :
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{BaSO}_{4(s)} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ba}_{(a q)}^{2+}+\mathrm{SO}_{4(a q)}^{2-} \\
& K_{s p}=\left[\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}\right]=s^{2} \\
& \quad=\left(1.04 \times 10^{-5}\right)^{2}=1.08 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~mol}^{2} \mathrm{~L}^{-2}
\end{aligned}
\]
107. (c) : Let solubility of \(\mathrm{Ag}_{2} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\) be \(s \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}\)
\[
\underset{s}{\mathrm{Ag}_{2} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4(s)}} \rightleftharpoons \underset{2 s}{2 \mathrm{Ag}_{(a q)}^{+}}+\underset{s}{\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4(a q)}^{2-}}
\]
\(K_{s p}=\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}^{2-}\right]\)
\(K_{s p}=(2 s)^{2}(s)=4 s^{3}\)
\(K_{s p}=4 \times\left(1.1 \times 10^{-4}\right)^{3}\)
\(\left(\because\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]=2 s=2.2 \times 10^{-4}\right)\)
\(K_{s p}=5.3 \times 10^{-12}\)
108. (b) : Let \(s\) be the solubility of AgCl in moles per litre.
\[
\underset{s}{\mathrm{AgCl}_{(a q)}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}_{(a q)}^{+}+\underset{s}{\mathrm{Cl}_{(a q)}^{-}}
\]
( \(\because 0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaCl}\) solution also provides \(0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)ion).
\(K_{s p}=\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right] ; 1.6 \times 10^{-10}=s(s+0.1)\)
\(1.6 \times 10^{-10}=s(0.1)\)
\[
(\because s \lll<0.1)
\]
\(s=\frac{1.6 \times 10^{-10}}{0.1}=1.6 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{M}\)
109. (d) : For \(M Y: K_{s p}=s_{1}^{2}\)
\(\Rightarrow s_{1}=\sqrt{K_{s p}}=\sqrt{6.2 \times 10^{-13}}=7.87 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}\)
For \(N Y_{3}: K_{s p}=\left(s_{2}\right)\left(3 s_{2}\right)^{3}=27 s_{2}^{4}\)

\section*{Salt}
\(\mathrm{Ag}_{2} \mathrm{CrO}_{4}\)
AgCl
AgBr
AgI
\(\Rightarrow s_{2}=\sqrt[4]{\frac{6.2 \times 10^{-13}}{27}}=3.89 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}\)
Hence, molar solubility of \(M Y\) in water is less than that of \(N Y_{3}\).
110. (b) :
\[
K_{s p}
\]
\(1.1 \times 10^{-12}=4 s^{3}\)
\[
1.8 \times 10^{-10}=s^{2}
\]
\(8.3 \times 10^{-17}=s^{2}\)

\section*{Solubility}
\[
s=\sqrt[3]{\frac{K_{s p}}{4}}=0.65 \times 10^{-4}
\]
\[
s=\sqrt{K_{s p}}=0.9 \times 10^{-8}
\]

Solubility of \(\mathrm{Ag}_{2} \mathrm{CrO}_{4}\) is highest thus, it will be precipitated at last.
111. (b) : \(\Delta G^{\circ}=-2.303 R T \log K_{s p}\)
\(63.3 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}=-2.303 \times 8.314 \times 298 \log K_{s p}\)
\(63.3 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}=-5705.84 \log K_{s p}\)
\(\log K_{s p}=-\frac{63.3 \times 10^{3}}{5705.84}=-11.09\)
\(K_{s p}=\operatorname{antilog}(-11.09)=8.128 \times 10^{-12}\)
112. (d) : \(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}\)
\[
\mathrm{CaC}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4} \rightarrow \underset{y}{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}+\underset{y}{\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}^{2-}}
\]

Now, \(\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]=x+y\)
and \(x(x+y)=4.7 \times 10^{-9} \quad \ldots\) (i) \(\quad y(x+y)=1.3 \times 10^{-9}\)

Dividing equation (i) and (ii) we get
\(\frac{x}{y}=3.6 \quad \therefore \quad x=3.6 y\)
Putting this value in equation (ii), we get
\[
y(3.6 y+y)=1.3 \times 10^{-9}
\]

On solving, we get \(y=1.68 \times 10^{-5}\)
and \(x=3.6 \times 1.68 \times 10^{-5}=6.05 \times 10^{-5}\)
\(\therefore \quad\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]=(x+y)=\left(1.68 \times 10^{-5}\right)+\left(6.05 \times 10^{-5}\right)\)
\(\therefore \quad\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]=7.73 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{M}\)
113. (b) : Sodium sulphide is soluble in water. The solubility product (and hence solubility) of ZnS is larger than that of CuS .
114. (b) : pH of solution \(=12\)
\(\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=10^{-12}\)
\(\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=\frac{10^{-14}}{10^{-12}}=10^{-2}\)
\(\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ba}^{2+}+\underset{2 s}{2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}}\)
\(2 s=10^{-2} \Rightarrow s=\frac{10^{-2}}{2}\)
\(K_{s p}=(s)(2 s)^{2}=4 s^{3}\)
\(=4 \times\left(\frac{10^{-2}}{2}\right)^{3}=\frac{4}{8} \times 10^{-6}=5 \times 10^{-7}\)
115. (c) : \(K_{s p}[\mathrm{AgCl}]=\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]\)
\(\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]=\frac{1.8 \times 10^{-10}}{10^{-1}}=1.8 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{M}\)
\(K_{\text {sp }}\left[\mathrm{PbCl}_{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]^{2}\)
\(\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]=\frac{1.7 \times 10^{-5}}{10^{-1} \times 10^{-1}}=1.7 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}\)
116. (a): The cations of group II are precipitated as their sulphides.
Solubility product of sulphide of group II radicals are very low. Therefore, even with low conc. of \(\mathrm{S}^{2-}\) ions, the ionic product exceeds the value of their solubility product and the radicals of group II gets precipitated. The low conc. of \(\mathrm{S}^{2-}\) ions is obtained by passing \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}\) gas through the solution of the salt in the presence of dil. HCl which suppresses degree of ionisation of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}\) by common ion effect.

Note that solubility product of group IV radicals are quite high. It is necessary to suppress the conc. of \(\mathrm{S}^{2-}\) ions, otherwise radical of group IV will also get precipitated along with group II radicals.
117. (c) : \(K_{s p}=3.2 \times 10^{-11}\)
\[
A X_{2} \rightleftharpoons A_{s}^{2+}+2 X_{2 s}^{-}
\]
\(K_{s p}=s \times(2 s)^{2}=4 s^{3}\); i.e., \(3.2 \times 10^{-11}=4 s^{3}\)
or, \(s^{3}=0.8 \times 10^{-11}=8 \times 10^{-12} \therefore s=2 \times 10^{-4}\)
118. (b) : \(\mathrm{AgI} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{I}^{-}\)
\(\mathrm{KI} \rightleftharpoons \underset{10^{-4} \mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{K}^{+}}+\underset{10^{-4} \mathrm{M} \text {, }}{\mathrm{I}^{-}}\)
[For \(\mathrm{KI}, 1 \mathrm{~N}=1 \mathrm{M}\) ]
\(\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]=s+10^{-4}\)
\(K_{\text {sp }}=\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]\)
\(1 \times 10^{-16}=s\left(s+10^{-4}\right) \Rightarrow 1 \times 10^{-16}=s^{2}+10^{-4} s\)
\(1 \times 10^{-16}=10^{-4} s\)
\(\left[\because s^{2} \lll 10^{-4} s\right]\)
\(\Rightarrow s=\frac{1 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-4}}=1 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}\)
119. (d) : Let \(s\) be the solubility of the electrolyte \(M X_{2}\).
\(\left[M^{2+}\right]=s,\left[X^{-}\right]=2 s\)

Solubility product, \(K_{s p}=s \times(2 s)^{2}=4 s^{3}\);
\(s=0.5 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~mol} /\) litre
\(\therefore \quad K_{s p}=4 \times\left(0.5 \times 10^{-4}\right)^{3} ; K_{s p}=5 \times 10^{-13}\)
120. (b) : For reaction, \(M_{2} \mathrm{~S} \rightleftharpoons \underset{2 s}{2 M^{+}}+\mathrm{S}^{2-}\)

Solubility \(=3.5 \times 10^{-6}\)
Solubility product, \(K_{s p}=\left[M^{+}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{~S}^{2-}\right]\)
\(=(2 s)^{2} s=4 s^{3}=4 \times\left(3.5 \times 10^{-6}\right)^{3}=1.7 \times 10^{-16}\)
121. (d) : For \(\mathrm{CaF}_{2}\), decomposition is as follows:
\[
\mathrm{CaF}_{2} \rightarrow \underset{s}{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}+\underset{2 s}{2 \mathrm{~F}^{-}}
\]
\(\Rightarrow \quad K_{s p}=\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{F}^{-}\right]^{2}=s \times(2 s)^{2}\)
or \(K_{s p}=4 s^{3} \Rightarrow K_{s p}=4 \times\left(2 \times 10^{-4}\right)^{3} \Rightarrow K_{s p}=32 \times 10^{-12}\)
122. (b) : The greater the solubility product, the greater is the solubility.
123. (a) : There are greater number of \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)ions in \(\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}\) compared to others. Hence, solubility of AgCl will be minimum in \(0.01 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}\) due to common ion effect.
124. (d): Higher the value of solubility product, greater is the solubility.

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (b) : Redox reactions are those chemical reactions which involve both oxidation and reduction simultaneously.
2. (a) : Oxidation number of Fe in \(\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CO})_{5}\) is zero.
3. (b) : Only 'Al' lies above ' Zn ' in electrochemical series, which can displace Zn from \(\mathrm{ZnCl}_{2}\) solution. Therefore, conc. of \(\mathrm{ZnCl}_{2}\) will decrease when kept in 'Al' container.
\(2 \mathrm{Al}+3 \mathrm{ZnCl}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{AlCl}_{3}+3 \mathrm{Zn}\)
4. (d) \(:{ }^{+2} \mathrm{BaCl}_{2}^{-1}+\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \rightarrow+6-2+\mathrm{BaSO}_{4}+2 \stackrel{+1}{\mathrm{NaCl}}-\stackrel{-1}{\mathrm{NaCl}}\)

Here no change in oxidation numbers take place. Hence it is not a redox reaction.
5. (c) : \(\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7(a q)}^{2-}+3 \mathrm{SO}_{3(a q)}^{2-}+8 \mathrm{H}_{(a q)}^{+} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Cr}_{(a q)}^{3+}+3 \mathrm{SO}_{4(a q)}^{2-}\)
\[
+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)}
\]
6. (c) : When a metal from the electrochemical series is mixed with the ions of a metal lower down in the electrochemical series, then more active metal displaces the less active one, this is known as metal displacement. Hence, the correct reaction is
\[
\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}+2 \mathrm{Al} \xrightarrow{\Delta} \mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}+2 \mathrm{Cr}
\]
7. (c) : In \(\mathrm{CH}_{4}\), oxidation number of carbon is -4 while in \(\mathrm{CCl}_{4}\), oxidation number of carbon is +4 . Thus, the change in oxidation number of carbon in the given reaction is from -4 to +4 .
8. (b)
9. (b) : Disproportionation reactions are those in which the same element/compound gets oxidised and reduced simultaneously.
\(2 \mathrm{Cu}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+\mathrm{Cu}^{0}\)
\({ }^{+6} \mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{2-}+4 \mathrm{H}^{+} \longrightarrow 2 \stackrel{+7}{M n O}_{4}^{-}+\stackrel{+4}{\mathrm{MnO}_{2}}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
10. (c): \(\mathrm{CrO}_{5}\) has butterfly structure having two peroxo bonds.
Peroxo oxygen has -1 oxidation state.
Let oxidation state of Cr be ' \(x\) '
\(\mathrm{CrO}_{5}: x+4(-1)+1(-2)=0 \Rightarrow x=+6\)
<smiles>O=[Ge]1(OO1)OO1</smiles>
\[
+5 \quad+2 \quad 0 \quad-3
\]
11. (a) : \(\mathrm{HNO}_{3}, \mathrm{NO}, \mathrm{N}_{2}, \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}\)
12. (b) : The correct balanced equation is
\(2 \mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+5 \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}^{2-}+16 \mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+10 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+8 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
13. (d) : \(\mathrm{CaF}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \rightarrow \mathrm{CaSO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{HF}\)

Here, the oxidation state of every atom remains the same so, it is not a redox reaction.
14. (c) : Increase in oxidation state (reducing agent)
\[
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-1}+\underset{\text { Decrease in oxidation state }}{\mathrm{O}_{3}} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}^{-2}+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}^{\mathrm{O}}
\]

\(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\) acts as reducing agent in both the reactions in which \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) is evolved.
15. (c) : Both \(\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}\) and \(\mathrm{SnCl}_{2}\) are reducing agents with low oxidation numbers.
16. (c): \({ }^{+1+5-2} \mathrm{KClO}_{3}+(\mathrm{COOH})_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{+6} \longrightarrow\)

Maximum change in oxidation number occurs in case of chlorine, i.e., from +5 to -1 .
17. (d) : Let oxidation number of P in \(\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}\) be \(x\).
\(\therefore \quad x+4(-2)=-3 \Rightarrow x=+5\)
Let oxidation number of S in \(\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}\) be \(y\).
\(\therefore y+4(-2)=-2 \Rightarrow y=+6\)
Let oxidation number of Cr in \(\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}^{2-}\) be \(z\).
\(\therefore 2 z+7(-2)=-2 \Rightarrow z=+6\)
18. (d) : \(\left[5 e^{-}+\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8 \mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} .\right.\). (i) \(] \times 2 \left[\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}^{2-} \rightarrow 2 e^{-}+2 \mathrm{CO}_{2} \ldots\right.\). (ii) \(] \times 5\)
On addition, we get
\(2 \mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+16 \mathrm{H}^{+}+5 \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}^{2-} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+10 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+8 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
2 moles of \(\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}\)required to oxidise 5 moles of oxalate.
∴ Number of moles of \(\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}\)required to oxidise 1 mole of oxalate \(=2 / 5=0.4\)
19. (b)
20. (a) : \(\mathrm{SO}_{3}^{2-}: x+(-2) 3=-2\) or \(x-6=-2\) or \(x=+4\)
\(\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}^{2-}: 2 x+(-2) 4=-2\)
or \(2 x-8=-2\) or \(2 x=+6 \quad \therefore x=+3\)
\(\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{6}^{2-}: 2 x+(-2) 6=-2\)
or \(2 x-12=-2\) or \(2 x=+10 \quad \therefore \quad x=+5\)
Oxidation states follow the order : \(\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}^{2-}<\mathrm{SO}_{3}^{2-}<\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{6}^{2-}\)
21. (d) \(: \mathrm{Fe}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{4}: 3 x+4(-2)=0 \Rightarrow x=+\frac{8}{3}\)
22. (a) : \(2 \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}+\mathrm{I}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{6}+2 \mathrm{NaI}\)
(Sodium tetrathionate)
23. (a) : Since carbon is in its maximum oxidation state of +4 , therefore, carbon dioxide ( \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) ) cannot act as a reducing agent.
24. (d) : Since the oxidation number of Ni increases from 0 to 2 , therefore it acts as a reducing agent.
25. (c) : Let \(x=\) Oxidation state of I . Since oxidation state of H \(=+1\) and oxidation state of \(\mathrm{O}=-2\), therefore for \(\mathrm{H}_{4} \mathrm{IO}_{6}^{-}\), we get \((4 \times 1)+x+(6 \times-2)=-1\) or \(x=+7\)
26. (c) : In redox couple, both the reduced and oxidised forms involve same element.
27. (d) : For a reaction to be spontaneous, \(\dot{E}_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}\) should be positive as \(\Delta G^{\circ}=-n F E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}\)
\(\mathrm{HBrO} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Br}_{2} ; E^{\circ}=1.595 \mathrm{~V}, \mathrm{SRP}\) (cathode)
\(\mathrm{HBrO} \longrightarrow \mathrm{BrO}_{3}^{-} ; E^{\circ}=-1.5 \mathrm{~V}\), SOP (anode)
\(2 \mathrm{HBrO} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Br}_{2}+\mathrm{BrO}_{3}^{-}\)
\(E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}=\) SRP (cathode) - SRP (anode)
\(=1.595-1.5=0.095 \mathrm{~V}\)
\(E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}>0 \Rightarrow \Delta G^{\circ}<0\) (spontaneous)

45. (c) : Among the given carbocations, \(\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) is most stable carbocation. As it consists of maximum number of \(\alpha\)-hydrogens and stablised by hyperconjugation.

\]
62. (a) : In case of different nucleophiles, but present in the same group in the periodic table, then larger is the atomic mass, higher is the nucleophilicity. Hence, the increasing order of nucleophilicity of the halide ions is

63. (d) :
<smiles>C[C-](C)(C)[C+](C)C</smiles>
\(3^{\circ}\) carbocation is more stable due to the stabilization of the charge by three methyl groups (or \(+I\) effect). It can also be explained on the basis of hyperconjugation.

2,3-Dimethylbutane
3. (a) : Dihedral angle of least stable conformer of ethane is \(0^{\circ}\). Magnitude of torsional strain depends upon the angle of rotation about \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}\) bond. This angle is also called dihedral angle or torsional angle. Of all the conformations of ethane, the staggered form has the least torsional strain and the eclipsed form, the maximum torsional strain.
4. (d) \(: \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{COO}^{-} \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{NaOH} \xrightarrow[\text { heat }]{\mathrm{CaO}}\)
\[
\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{3}+\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}
\]
5. (c) : Wurtz reaction is used for the preparation of higher alkanes containing even number of C -atoms. Thus this reaction cannot be used for the preparation of \(n\)-heptane.
6. (b) : In chlorination of alkanes, hydrogen is replaced by chlorine. In neo-pentane, only one type of hydrogen is present, hence replacement of any hydrogen atom will give the same product.

8. (c) : Conformers of ethane have different dihedral angles but same bond angle and bond lengths.
9. (b) : Magnitude of torsional strain depends upon the angle of rotation about C-C bond. Staggered form has the least torsional strain and the eclipsed form has the maximum torsional strain. So, the staggered conformation of ethane is more stable than the eclipsed conformation.

10. (b) : The anti-conformation is the most stable conformation of \(n\)-butane as in this, the bulky methyl groups are as far apart as possible thereby keeping steric repulsion at aminimum.
11. (b) : The process of cracking converts higher alkanes into smaller alkanes and alkenes. This process can be used for production of natural gas.
12. (d): The conformation (d) is most stable because of intramolecular H -bonding.
13. (c) : The staggered form of ethane has the following structure and the dihedral angle is \(60^{\circ}\), which means ' H ' atoms are at an angle of \(60^{\circ}\) to each other.

At anode : \(2 \mathrm{RCOO}--2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \underset{\text { Alkane }}{R-R+2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}}\)
15. (c): The branching of chain increases the octane number of a fuel. High octane number means better fuel.
16. (b) : Newman projections for \(n\)-butane are

The staggered conformation has minimum repulsion between the hydrogen atoms attached tetrahedrally to the two carbon atoms. Thus, it is the most stable conformation.
17. (c): Tetraethyllead \(\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)_{4} \mathrm{~Pb}\), is used as an antiknocking agent in gasoline used for running automobiles.
18. (d) : The reactivity of H -atom depends upon the stability of free radicals, therefore reactivity of H -atom follows the order: \(3^{\circ}>2^{\circ}>1^{\circ}\).

34. (a) : The relative rates of hydrogenation decrease with the increase of steric hindrance. Most stable the alkene, slowly it undergoes hydrogenation to give the product. Least substituted alkene is less stable and more reactive.
Order of stability is :

Hence, alkene which will react faster with \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\) is that which is most unstable.

35. (d) : The formation of n-propyl bromide in presence of peroxide can be explained as follow :
Step 1 : Peroxide undergoes fission to give free radicals.
\[
\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{R} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{O}
\]

Step 2 : HBr combines with free radical to form bromine free radical.
\[
R-\stackrel{\circ}{\mathrm{O}}+\mathrm{HBr} \longrightarrow R-\mathrm{OH}+\dot{\mathrm{B}} \mathrm{r}
\]

Step \(3: \mathrm{Br}\) attacks the double bond of the alkene to form a more stable free radical.

37. (c) : Geometrical isomers are those isomers which possess the same molecular and structural formula but differ in the arrangement of atoms or groups in space due to hindered rotation around the double bonded atoms.
38. (b) : Temperature is an effective factor because at different temperature it forms different products.
\(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OH} \xrightarrow[-\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}]{\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}, 620 \mathrm{~K}} \mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}\)
This is intramolecular dehydration. At lower temperature, intermolecular dehydration takes place between two molecules of alcohol and ether will be formed.
39. (b) : Propene adds to diborane \(\left(\mathrm{B}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}\right)\) giving an addition product. The addition compound on oxidation gives 1-propanol. Here addition of water takes place according to anti-Markownikoff's rule.
40. (c) :

Therefore, \(M=\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OH}\) and \(R=\) aq. \(\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}\)
44. (d) : In this reaction, HBr undergoes heterolytic fission as \(\mathrm{HBr} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{Br}^{-}\)
\(\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}+\mathrm{HBr} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\stackrel{+}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\)

This is an example of electrophilic addition reaction.

46. (c) : In case of but-2-ene \(\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)\) both double bonded carbons are identical. Therefore, it does not observe the anti-Markownikoff's addition of HBr .

There are \(21 \sigma\) bonds.
51. (a) : Alkanes, alkenes and alkynes follow the following trend in their acidic behaviour:
\(\stackrel{s p}{\mathrm{HC}} \equiv \stackrel{s p}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}>\stackrel{s p^{2}}{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{C}}=\stackrel{s p^{2}}{\mathrm{CH}_{2}}>\stackrel{s p^{3}}{\mathrm{CH}_{3}}-\stackrel{s p^{3}}{\mathrm{CH}_{3}}\)
This is because \(s p\)-hybridised carbon is more electronegative than \(s p^{2}\)-hybridised carbon which is further more electronegative than \(s p^{3}\)-hybridised carbon. Hence, in ethyne proton can be released more easily than ethene and ethane.
Among alkynes the order of acidity is :
\(\mathrm{HC} \equiv \mathrm{CH}>\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{CH}>\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\)
This is due to \(+I\) effect of \(-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) group.
52. (c) : In case of unsymmetrical alkynes addition of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) occurs in accordance with Markownikoff's rule.

55. (b) : \(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{2}+\frac{5}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)

Both ethyne and \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) have \(s p\)-hybridisation.
\[
\mathrm{O}=\stackrel{s p}{\mathrm{C}}=\mathrm{O} \quad \stackrel{s p}{\mathrm{HC}} \equiv \stackrel{s p}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}
\]
56. (a) : Terminal alkynes (1-butyne) react with \(\mathrm{NaNH}_{2}\) to form sodium acetylide and evolve ammonia but 2-butyne do not.
57. (b) : \(\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\)

In case of \(s p^{3}\) hybridised carbon, bond angle is \(109^{\circ} 28^{\prime}\);
\(s p^{2}\) hybridised carbon, bond angle is \(120^{\circ}\) and \(s p\) hybridised carbon, bond angle is \(180^{\circ}\).
So, only

According to Markownikoff's rule, during hydrohalogenation to unsymmetrical alkene, the negative part of the addendum adds to less hydrogenated (i.e. more substituted) carbon atom.
60. (b) : On ozonolysis, higher alkynes form diketones which are further oxidised to dicarboxylic acid.

63. (b) : In alkyne, two carbon atoms constituting the triple bond are \(s p\)-hybridised. Carbon undergoes \(s p\)-hybridisation to form two \(s p\)-hybrid orbitals. The two \(2 p\)-orbitals remain unhybridised. Hybrid orbitals form one sigma bond while two \(\pi\)-bonds are formed by unhybridised orbitals.
64. (c) : A powerful base is needed to carry out second dehydrohalogenation reaction e.g., hot alcoholic KOH solution or alkoxide ion.
65. (a) : Alkynes react with strong bases like \(\mathrm{NaNH}_{2}\) to form sodium acetylide derivative known as acetylides.
\(\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{NaNH}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \overline{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{Na}^{+}+1 / 2 \mathrm{H}_{2}\)
66. (d) : Shortest C-C distance ( \(1.20 \AA\) ) is in acetylene.

The formation of \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}\) bond in acetylene involves \(s p\)-hybridised carbon atom. Since \(s\)-electrons are closer to the nucleus than \(p\)-electrons, the electrons present in a bond having more \(s\)-character will be more closer to the nucleus. In alkynes \(s\) character is \(50 \%\), the electrons constituting this bond are more strongly bonded by the carbon nucleus. Thus, acetylenic C -atom becomes more electronegative in comparison to \(s p^{2}\), \(s p^{3}\) and hence the hydrogen atom present on carbon atom ( \(\equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}\) ) can be easily removed.
68. (d) : The compound 3 possessing the terminal alkyne only reacts with ammoniacal \(\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}\) and thus can be distinguished from 1, 2 and 4 compounds.

These compounds obey Huckel's rule as these contain ( \(4 n+2\) ) \(\pi\) electrons.
70. (d) : Compound (d) is not an aromatic compound as reflected by the non-planarity of the methylene bridge ( \(-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\) ) with respect to other atoms. However, tropylium cation is aromatic due to planarity.
71. (c) : The attacking species in the reaction given in option \(\delta+\) (c) is an electrophile i.e., Cl . Therefore, it is an electrophilic substitution reaction.

Chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and chloroethene are not suitable halide components as \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{X}\) bond acquires some double bond character due to resonance of lone pair of electrons with \(\pi\)-bond.
73. (a) : Biphenyl is coplanar as all C -atoms are \(s p^{2}\) hybridised.
74. (d) : Pyrrole has maximum electron density on 2 and 5. It generally reacts with electrophiles at the \(\mathrm{C}-2\) or \(\mathrm{C}-5\) due to the highest degree of stability of the protonated intermediate.

Attack at position 3 or 4 yields a carbocation that is a hybrid of structures (I) and (II). Attack at position 2 or 5 yields a carbocation that is a hybrid not only of structures (III) and (IV) (analogous to I and II) but also of structure (V). The extra stabilization conferred by ( V ) makes this ion the more stable one. Also, attack at position 2 or 5 is faster because the developing positive charge is accommodated by three atoms of the ring instead of only two.

If a large amount of \(\mathrm{KHSO}_{4}\) is added then conc. of \(\mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-}\)ions increases and the reaction will be shifted in backward direction hence, the rate of nitration will be slower.

79. (b) : \(-\mathrm{NO}_{2}\) is most deactivating due to \(-I\) and \(-M\) effect.
80. (a) : Nitrobenzene is strongly deactivated, hence will not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction.

86. (a) : Groups like, -Cl and \(-\mathrm{NO}_{2}\) shows \(-I\) effect. \(-I\) groups attached to the benzene ring decrease the electron density and hence less prone to electrophilic attack. - OH not only shows \(-I\) effect but also \(+M\) effect which predominates the \(-I\) character and electron density is increased in the benzene ring which facilitates electrophilic attack.
87. (c) : Benzene having any activating group i.e., \(-\mathrm{OH},-R\) undergoes electrophilic substitution easily as compared to benzene itself. Thus, toluene and phenol undergo electrophilic substitution easily. Chlorine due to \(-I\)-effect deactivates the ring. So, it is difficult to carry out the electrophilic substitution in chlorobenzene. Hence, the order is \(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}>\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CH}_{3}>\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{6}>\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{Cl}\).

\(-\mathrm{NH}_{2}\) group is electron donating hence increases electron density on ring. Benzene is also electron rich due to delocalisation of electrons. - \(\mathrm{NO}_{2}\) group is electron withdrawing hence, decreases electron density on ring.

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (d) : \(m=\frac{1000 \times M}{1000 \times d-\left(M M_{w}\right)}\)

Here, \(M=\) molarity of the solution, \(d=\) density of solution, \(M_{w}=\) Molar mass of the solute
\(m=\frac{1000 \times 1}{(1000 \times 1.25)-(1 \times 85)}=\frac{1000}{1165}=0.858 \mathrm{~m}\)
2. (b) : Molality \((m)=\frac{\text { Moles of solute }}{\text { Mass of solvent in } \mathrm{kg}}\)

Let amount of solvent be \(x \mathrm{~g}\).
\(1=\frac{0.5}{\frac{x}{1000}}\)
\(x=500 \mathrm{~g}\)
3. (a) : Molarity is a function of temperature as volume depends on temperature.
4. (c) : 1 molal aqueous solution means 1 mole of solute is present in 1000 g of water.
\(\therefore \quad x_{\text {solute }}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{1000}{18}}=\frac{1}{56.5}=0.0177\)
5. (c) : Molarity \(=\frac{w_{\mathrm{HNO}_{3}} \times 1000}{M_{\mathrm{HNO}_{3}} \times V_{\text {sol(mL) }}}\)
or \(2=\frac{w_{\mathrm{HNO}_{3}}}{63} \times \frac{1000}{250} \Rightarrow w_{\mathrm{HNO}_{3}}=\frac{63}{2} \mathrm{~g}\)
Mass of acid \(\times \frac{70}{100}=\frac{63}{2}\)
Mass of acid \(=45 \mathrm{~g}\)
6. (c) : \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\) is \(98 \%\) by weight.

Weight of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}=98 \mathrm{~g}\), Weight of solution \(=100 \mathrm{~g}\)
\(\therefore \quad\) Volume of solution \(=\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { density }}=\frac{100}{1.80} \mathrm{~mL}\)
\[
=55.55 \mathrm{~mL}=0.0555 \mathrm{~L}
\]

Molarity of solution \(=\frac{98}{98 \times 0.0555}=18.02 \mathrm{M}\)
Let \(V \mathrm{~mL}\) of this \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\) is used to prepare 1 litre of \(0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\).
\(\therefore \mathrm{mM}\) of concentrated \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}=\mathrm{mM}\) of dilute \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\)
or, \(\quad V \times 18.02=1000 \times 0.1\)
\(\Rightarrow V=\frac{1000 \times 0.1}{18.02}=5.55 \mathrm{~mL}\)
7. (b) : 1 molal aqueous solution means 1 mole of solute present in 1 kg of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\).
1 mole of solute present in \(\frac{1000}{18}\) mole of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
\(x_{\text {solute }}=\frac{1}{\frac{1000}{18}+1}=\frac{18}{1018}=0.01768 \approx 0.018\)
8. (c) : Molecular weight of \(\mathrm{NaOH}=40 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
2.5 litre of 1 M NaOH solution contain
\[
40 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \times 1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1} \times 2.5 \mathrm{~L}=40 \times 2.5 \mathrm{~g} \text { of } \mathrm{NaOH}
\]

3 litre of 0.5 M NaOH solution contain
\(40 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \times 0.5 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1} \times 3 \mathrm{~L}=40 \times 0.5 \times 3 \mathrm{~g}\) of NaOH
If these two solutions are mixed, the volume of the resultant solution \(=(2.5+3)=5.5\) litre.
5.5 litre of the resultant solution contain \(=40(2.5+1.5) \mathrm{g}\) of NaOH 1 litre of the resultant solution contain
\(\frac{40 \times 4}{5.5} \mathrm{~g}\) of \(\mathrm{NaOH}=\frac{40 \times 4}{5.5 \times 40}\) mole of NaOH
The molarity of the resultant solution \(=0.727 \approx 0.73 \mathrm{M}\)
9. (c) : The strength of the solution is 0.1 N .
\(\frac{w}{E}=\frac{V \times N}{1000}\)
(Equivalent weight \(=\frac{200}{2}=100\) )
\(\Rightarrow \quad w=\frac{100 \times 0.1 \times 100}{1000}=1 \mathrm{~g}\)
10. (a) : We know that \(98 \% \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\) by weight means 98 g of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\) is present in 100 g of solution.
Therefore, its weight is 98 and moles of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{\text { Weight of } \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}}{\text { Molecular weight }}=\frac{98}{98}=1 \\
\text { and volume of solution }= & \frac{\text { Mass }}{\text { Density }} \\
& =\frac{100}{1.84}=54.35 \mathrm{~mL}=\frac{54.35}{1000} \mathrm{~L}
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, molarity of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\)
\(=\frac{\text { Moles of } \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}}{\text { Volume (in litres) }}=\frac{1 \times 1000}{54.35}=18.4 \mathrm{M}\)
11. (c): The molality involves weights of the solute and the solvent. Since the weight does not change with the temperature, therefore molality does not depend upon the temperature.
12. (c) : Since the molecular mass of \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}\) is 32 , therefore quantity of \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}\) to prepare 150 mL solution of \(2 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH} =\left(\frac{2}{1000}\right) \times 150 \times 32=9.6 \mathrm{~g}\)
13. (b) : According to Henry's law, higher the value of \(K_{H}\) at a given pressure, lower is the solubility of the gas in the liquid. Thus, solubility order of given gases will be :
\[
B>C>A
\]
14. (d) : \(P_{\text {total }}=p_{\text {benzene }} x_{\text {benzene }}+p_{\text {octane }} x_{\text {octane }}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& =280 \times \frac{3}{5}+420 \times \frac{2}{5}=168+168 \\
& =336 \mathrm{~mm} \text { of } \mathrm{Hg}
\end{aligned}
\]
15. (c) : \(p_{\text {water vapour }}=x_{\text {water vapour }} \times P_{\text {total }}\)
\[
=0.02 \times 1.2=0.024 \mathrm{~atm}
\]
\(P_{\text {total }}=p_{\text {water vapour }}+p_{\text {dry air }}\)
\(1.2=0.024+p_{\text {dry air }}\)
\(p_{\text {dry air }}=1.2-0.024=1.176 \mathrm{~atm}\)
Partial vapour pressure is directly proportional to mole fraction, \(p \propto x\).
16. (d) : According to Raoult's law,
\[
P=x_{A} p_{A}+x_{B} p_{B}
\]

For binary solutions,
\[
x_{A}+x_{B}=1, \quad x_{B}=1-x_{A}
\]

Putting value of \(x_{B}\) from eqn. (ii) to eqn. (i)
\(P=x_{A} p_{A}+\left(1-x_{A}\right) p_{B}=x_{A} p_{A}+p_{B}-x_{A} p_{B}\)
\(P=p_{B}+x_{A}\left(p_{A}-p_{B}\right)\)
17. (None) :
\(p^{\circ}{ }_{\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}}=200 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, p^{\circ}{ }_{\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}}=41.5 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\)
Moles of \(\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}=\frac{\text { Weight }}{\text { Molecular weight }}=\frac{25.5}{119.5}=0.2132111\)
Moles of \(\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}=\frac{40}{85}=0.470\)
\(x_{\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}}=\frac{0.213}{0.213+0.470}=0.31\)
\(x_{\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}}=\frac{0.470}{0.213+0.470}=0.69\)
\(P_{\text {total }}=p^{\circ}{ }_{\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}} x_{\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}}+p^{\circ}{ }_{\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}} x_{\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}}\)
\[
=200 \times 0.31+41.5 \times 0.69=62+28.63=90.63 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}
\]
18. (d) : \(\frac{n_{C_{5} H_{12}}}{n_{C_{6} H_{14}}}=\frac{1}{4}\)
\(\Rightarrow x_{\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12}}=\frac{1}{5}\) and \(x_{\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{14}}=\frac{4}{5}\)
\(P^{\circ} \mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12}=440 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} ; p_{\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{14}}^{\circ}=120 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\)
\(\begin{aligned} P_{\text {total }} & =p^{\circ} \mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12} x_{\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12}}+p^{\circ} \mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{14} x_{\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{14}} \\ & =440 \times \frac{1}{5}+120 \times \frac{4}{5}=88+96=184 \mathrm{~mm} \text { of } \mathrm{Hg}\end{aligned}\)
By Raoult's law, \(P_{\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12}}=P^{\circ} \mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12} x_{\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12}}\)
\(x_{\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12}} \rightarrow\) mole fraction of pentane in solution.
By Dalton's law, \(P_{\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12}}=x^{\prime}{ }_{\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12}} P_{\text {total }}\)
\(x^{\prime} \mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12} \rightarrow\) mole fraction of pentane above the solution.
From (1) and (2),
\(p_{\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12}}=440 \times \frac{1}{5}=88 \mathrm{~mm}\) of Hg
\(\Rightarrow 88=x^{\prime} \mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12} \times 184 \Rightarrow x^{\prime} \mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12}=\frac{88}{184}=0.478\)
19. (a) : By Raoult's Law, \(P_{T}=p_{P}^{\circ} x_{P}+p_{Q}^{\circ} x_{Q}\)
where \(p_{P}^{\circ}=80\) torr, \(p_{Q}^{\circ}=60\) torr, \(x_{P}=\frac{3}{5} ; x_{Q}=\frac{2}{5}\)
\(P_{T}=80 \times \frac{3}{5}+60 \times \frac{2}{5}=48+24=72\) torr
20. (a) : Mixture of ethanol and acetone shows positive deviation from Raoult's law.
In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded. On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult's law.
21. (d) : For an ideal solution, \(\Delta_{\text {mix }} H=0\) and \(\Delta_{\text {mix }} V=0\) at constant \(T\) and \(P\).
22. (b) : Maximum boiling azeotropes are formed by those solutions which show negative deviations from Raoult's law. \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) and \(\mathrm{HNO}_{3}\) mixture shows negative deviations.
23. (a) : In case of positive deviation from Raoult's law, \(A-B\) interactions are weaker than those between \(A-A\) or \(B-B\), i.e., in this case the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules are weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This means that in such solution, molecules of \(A\) (or \(B\) ) will find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour pressure and result in positive deviation.
24. (d) : For an ideal solution,
\[
\Delta H_{\operatorname{mix}}=0, \Delta V_{\operatorname{mix}}=0
\]

Now, \(\Delta U_{\text {mix }}=\Delta H_{\text {mix }}-P \Delta V_{\text {mix }}\)
\(\therefore \Delta U_{\text {mix }}=0\)
Also, for an ideal solution,
\[
\begin{gathered}
P_{A}=x_{A} P_{A}^{\circ}, P_{B}=x_{B} P_{B}^{\circ} \\
\therefore \quad \Delta P=P_{\text {obs }}-P_{\text {calculated by Raoult's law }}=0 \\
\Delta G_{\text {mix }}=\Delta H_{\text {mix }}-T \Delta S_{\text {mix }}
\end{gathered}
\]

For an ideal solution, \(\Delta S_{\text {mix }} \neq 0\)
\(\therefore \quad \Delta G_{\text {mix }} \neq 0\)
25. (c) : \(p_{\text {Benzene }}=x_{\text {Benzene }} p^{\circ}{ }_{\text {Benzene }}\)
\[
p_{\text {Toluene }}=x_{\text {Toluene }} p_{\text {Toluene }}^{\circ}
\]

For an ideal 1:1 molar mixture of benzene and toluene,
\(x_{\text {Benzene }}=\frac{1}{2}\) and \(x_{\text {Toluene }}=\frac{1}{2}\)
\(p_{\text {Benzene }}=\frac{1}{2} p_{\text {Benzene }}^{\circ}=\frac{1}{2} \times 12.8 \mathrm{kPa}=6.4 \mathrm{kPa}\)
\(p_{\text {Toluene }}=\frac{1}{2} p_{\text {Toluene }}^{\circ}=\frac{1}{2} \times 3.85 \mathrm{kPa}=1.925 \mathrm{kPa}\)
Thus, the vapour will contain a high percentage of benzene as the partial vapour pressure of benzene is higher as compared to that of toluene.
26. (b) : For an ideal solution :
- Volume change ( \(\Delta V\) ) on mixing should be zero.
- Heat change ( \(\Delta H\) ) on mixing should be zero.
- Obeys Raoult's law at every range of concentration.
- Entropy change \((\Delta S)\) on mixing \(\neq 0\).
27. (c) : Both the components escape easily showing higher vapour pressure than the expected value. This is due to breaking of some hydrogen bonds between ethanol molecules.
28. (c) : Raoult's law is valid for ideal solutions only. The element of non-ideality enters into the picture when the molecules of the solute and solvent affect each others intermolecular forces. A solution containing components of \(A\) and \(B\) behaves as ideal solution when \(A-B\) attraction force remains same as \(A-A\) and \(B-B\) attraction forces.
29. (d) : \(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}\) is associated through H-bonding while \(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{I}\) does not show H -bonding.
30. (c) : For ideal solution,
\[
\Delta V_{\text {mixing }}=0 \text { and } \Delta H_{\text {mixing }}=0
\]
31. (a) : As we know, \(\pi=C R T\)

The plot of \(\pi\) (osmotic pressure) vs concentration will give (On comparing with straight line equation \(y=m x+C\) )
Slope \(=(m)=R T\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& 25.73=R T \\
& T=\frac{25.73}{R}=\frac{25.73}{0.083}=310 \mathrm{~K} \\
& T=310 \mathrm{~K} \text { or } 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\end{aligned}
\]
32. (b) : Osmotic pressure \((\pi)=C R T\)
\(\therefore \quad \pi \propto C\)
For glucose solution, \(C_{1}=\frac{10}{180} \times \frac{1000}{250}=0.22 \mathrm{M}\)
For urea solution, \(C_{2}=\frac{10}{60} \times \frac{1000}{250}=0.66 \mathrm{M}\)
For sucrose solution, \(C_{3}=\frac{10}{342} \times \frac{1000}{250}=0.117 \mathrm{M}\)
Hence, order of osmotic pressure is \(P_{2}>P_{1}>P_{3}\).
33. (c) : Given : \(K_{f}=5.12 \mathrm{~K} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}, m=0.078 \mathrm{~m}\)
\(\Delta T_{f}=K_{f} \times m=5.12 \times 0.078=0.39936 \approx 0.40 \mathrm{~K}\)
34. (c) : The value of molal depression constant, \(K_{f}\) is constant for a particular solvent, thus, it will be unchanged when molality of the dilute solution is doubled.
35. (c) : Given : \(W_{B}=6.5 \mathrm{~g}, W_{A}=100 \mathrm{~g}\),
\(p_{s}=732 \mathrm{~mm}, K_{b}=0.52, T_{b}^{\circ}=100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, p^{\circ}=760 \mathrm{~mm}\)
\(\frac{p^{\circ}-p_{s}}{p^{\circ}}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} \Rightarrow \frac{760-732}{760}=\frac{n_{2}}{100 / 18}\)
\(\Rightarrow n_{2}=\frac{28 \times 100}{760 \times 18}=0.2046 \mathrm{~mol}\)
\(\Delta T_{b}=K_{b} \times m\)
\(T_{b}-T^{\circ}{ }_{b}=K_{b} \times \frac{n_{2} \times 1000}{W_{A}(\mathrm{~g})}\)
\(T_{b}-100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=\frac{0.52 \times 0.2046 \times 1000}{100}=1.06\)
\(T_{b}=100+1.06=101.06^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)
36. (b) : A \(35 \%(V / V)\) solution of ethylene glycol is used as an antifreeze in cars for cooling the engine. At this concentration, the antifreeze lowers the freezing point of water to 255.4 K ( \(-17.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) ).
37. (d) : We know that \(p V=n R T\), where \(n=\frac{w}{M}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
\pi V & =\frac{w}{M} R T \\
M=\frac{w R T}{\pi V} & =\frac{1.26 \times 0.083 \times 300}{2.57 \times 10^{-3} \times \frac{200}{1000}} \\
& =\frac{1.26 \times 0.083 \times 300}{2.57 \times 10^{-3} \times 0.2}=61038 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
\]
38. (a) : We know, \(\Delta T_{f}=K_{f} m\)
\[
m=\frac{w_{B}}{M_{B}} \times \frac{1000}{W_{A}}=\frac{68.5 \times 1000}{342 \times 1000}=\frac{68.5}{342}
\]
\(\Delta T_{f}=1.86 \times \frac{68.5}{342}=0.372^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)
\(\therefore T_{f}=0-0.372^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=-0.372^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)
39. (a)
40. (b) : \(M_{B}=\frac{1000 \times K_{f} \times w_{B}}{W_{A} \times \Delta T_{f}}\)
or, \(250=\frac{1000 \times 5.12 \times 1}{51.2 \times \Delta T_{f}}\)
\(\therefore \Delta T_{f}=\frac{1000 \times 5.12 \times 1}{51.2 \times 250}=0.4 \mathrm{~K}\)
41. (c) : Molar concentration of urea \(=\frac{10}{60} \mathrm{dm}^{-3}\)

Molar concentration of non-volatile solution
\[
=\frac{50}{M_{B}} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}=\frac{50}{M_{B}} \mathrm{dm}^{-3}
\]

For isotonic solutions, \(\frac{10}{60}=\frac{50}{M_{B}}\)
\(\Rightarrow M_{B}=300 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
42. (b) : \(\Delta T_{f}=K_{f} m\)
\(\Delta T_{b}=K_{b} m\)
\(\Rightarrow \quad \frac{\Delta T_{f}}{\Delta T_{b}}=\frac{K_{f}}{K_{b}}\)
\(\Delta T_{f} \rightarrow\) depression in freezing point
\(\Delta T_{b} \rightarrow\) elevation in boiling point
\(K_{f}=1.86 \mathrm{~K} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
\(K_{b}=0.512 \mathrm{~K} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}, \Delta T_{b}=100.18-100=0.18\)
⇒ From eq. (3), \(\frac{\Delta T_{f}}{0.18}=\frac{1.86}{0.512}\)
\(\Rightarrow \Delta T_{f}=0.654=T_{f}^{\circ}-T_{f}=0-T_{f} \Rightarrow T_{f}=-0.654^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)
⇒ Freezing point of urea in water \(=-0.654^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)
43. (b) : For dilute solution, \(\pi=\frac{n}{V} R T\)
\(\Rightarrow \pi V=\frac{m_{2}}{M_{2}} R T \Rightarrow M_{2}=\frac{m_{2} R T}{\pi V}\)
44. (c)
45. (a)
46. (a) : \(p_{\text {benzene }}^{\circ}=640 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, p_{s}=600 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\), \(w_{B}=2.175 \mathrm{~g}, W_{\text {benzene }}=39.08 \mathrm{~g}\)
From Raoult's law
\(\frac{p^{\circ}-p_{s}}{p^{\circ}}=\frac{w_{B} \times M_{\text {benzene }}}{W_{\text {benzene }} \times M_{B}} \Rightarrow \frac{640-600}{640}=\frac{2.175 \times 78}{39.08 \times M_{B}}\)
\(\Rightarrow M_{B}=69.5\)
47. (b) : \(w_{B}=0.15 \mathrm{~g}, W_{A}=15 \mathrm{~g}, \Delta T_{b}=0.216^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)
\(K_{b}=2.16, m=\) ?
As \(\Delta T_{b}=\frac{1000 \times K_{b} \times w_{B}}{M_{B} \times W_{A}}\)
\(\Rightarrow M_{B}=\frac{1000 \times 2.16 \times 0.15}{0.216 \times 15}=100\)
48. (a) :
\[

\]

For isotonic solutions, \(C_{1}=C_{2}\)
\(\frac{W_{1}}{M_{1} V_{1}}=\frac{W_{2}}{M_{2} V_{2}} \Rightarrow \frac{5}{342 \times 0.1}=\frac{1}{M_{2} \times 0.1}\)
\(\Rightarrow M_{2}=\frac{342}{5}=68.4\)
49. (b) : \(x_{2}\) (mole fraction of solute) \(=0.2\)

From Raoult's law,
\(\frac{p^{\circ}-p_{s}}{p^{\circ}}=x_{2} \Rightarrow \frac{10}{p^{\circ}}=0.2 \Rightarrow p^{\circ}=50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\)
Again, when \(p^{\circ}-p_{s}=20 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\), then
\(\frac{p^{\circ}-p_{s}}{p^{\circ}}=\) mole fraction of solute \(=\frac{20}{50}=0.4\)
⇒ mole fraction of solvent \(=1-0.4=0.6\)
50. (c) : Vapour pressure of pure solvent \(\left(p_{A}^{\circ}\right)=143 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\), weight of solute \(\left(w_{B}\right)=0.5 \mathrm{~g}\), weight of solvent \(\left(W_{A}\right)=100 \mathrm{~g}\), molecular weight of solute \(\left(M_{B}\right)=65\) and molecular weight of solvent \(\left(M_{A}\right)=154\).
\[
\frac{p_{A}^{\circ}-p_{s}}{p_{A}^{\circ}}=\frac{w_{B} M_{A}}{M_{B} W_{A}} \text { or } \frac{143-p_{s}}{143}=\frac{0.5 \times 154}{65 \times 100}
\]
or \(p_{s}=141.31 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\)
51. (a) : Weight of glucose \(=10 \mathrm{~g}\),

Weight of urea \(=10 \mathrm{~g}\) and weight of sucrose \(=10 \mathrm{~g}\)
The number of moles of glucose,
\(\left(n_{1}\right)=\frac{\text { Weight }}{\text { Molecular weight }}=\frac{10}{180}=0.05\)
Similarly, number of moles of urea \(\left(n_{2}\right)=\frac{10}{60}=0.16\) and the number of moles of sucrose \(\left(n_{3}\right)=\frac{10}{342}=0.03\)
The osmotic pressure is a colligative property and it depends upon the number of moles of a solute.
Since \(n_{2}>n_{1}>n_{3}\), therefore \(p_{2}>p_{1}>p_{3}\).
52. (a)
53. (a) : There is no net movement of the solvent through the semipermeable membrane between two solutions of equal concentration.
54. (c) :The properties which depend only upon the number of solute particles present in the solution irrespective of their nature are called colligative properties. Lowering in vapour pressure, elevation in boiling point, depression in freezing point and osmotic pressure are colligative properties.
55. (b) : Blood cells neither swell nor shrink in isotonic solution. The solutions having same osmotic pressure are called isotonic solutions.
56. (b) : Relative lowering of vapour pressure is equal to mole fraction of solute which is the ratio of solute molecules to the total molecules in solution.
57. (a) : \(i \times M \downarrow \Rightarrow \Delta T_{b} \downarrow\)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Electrolyte & \(\boldsymbol{i} \times \boldsymbol{M}\) \\
\hline NaCl & \(2 \times 0.05=0.1\) \\
\hline KCl & \(2 \times 0.1=0.2\) \\
\hline \(\mathrm{MgSO}_{4}\) & \(2 \times 0.1=0.2\) \\
\hline NaCl & \(2 \times 1=2\) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
58. (d) : Being a strong electrolyte, \(\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\) undergoes \(100 \%\) dissociation in a dilute aqueous solution,
\[
\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_{2(a q)} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ba}^{2+}{ }_{(a q)}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}{ }_{(a q)}
\]

Thus, van't Hoff factor \(i=3\).
59. (c) \(: \Delta T_{b}=i K_{b} m\)

For equimolal solutions, elevation in boiling point will be higher if solution undergoes dissociation i.e., \(i>1\).
60. (c) : \(\Delta T_{f}=i \times K_{f} \times m\)

So, \(\Delta T_{f} \propto i\) (van't Hoff factor)

\begin{tabular}{ll} 
Salt & \(i\) \\
KCl & 2 \\
\(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}\) & 1 \\
\(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3}\) & 5 \\
\(\mathrm{~K}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\) & 3
\end{tabular}

Hence, \(i\) is maximum i.e., 5 for \(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3}\).
61. (c) : From the value of van't Hoff factor \(i\) it is possible to determine the degree of dissociation or association. In case of dissociation, \(i\) is greater than 1 and in case of association \(i\) is less than 1 .
62. (b) : We know that
\[
\Delta T_{f}=i \times K_{f} \times \frac{w_{B} \times 1000}{M_{B} \times W_{A}}
\]

Given : \(\Delta T_{f}=3.82, K_{f}=1.86\),
\(w_{B}=5, M_{B}=142, W_{A}=45\)
\(i=\frac{\Delta T_{f} \times M_{B} \times W_{A}}{K_{f} \times w_{B} \times 1000}=\frac{3.82 \times 142 \times 45}{1.86 \times 5 \times 1000}=2.63\)
63. (d) : We know that \(\Delta T_{f}=i \times K_{f} \times m\)

Here \(i\) is van't Hoff factor.
\(i\) for weak acid is \(1+\alpha\).
Here \(\alpha\) is degree of dissociation i.e., \(30 / 100=0.3\)
\(\therefore \quad i=1+\alpha=1+0.3=1.3\)
\(\Delta T_{f}=i \times K_{f} \times m=1.3 \times 1.86 \times 0.1=0.24\)
\(\therefore \quad\) Freezing point of solution, \(T_{f}=T^{\circ}{ }_{f}-\Delta T_{f}\)
\[
=0-0.24=-0.24^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\]
64. (d) : Addition of water to an aqueous solution of KI causes the concentration of the solution to decrease thereby increasing the vapour pressure. In the other three options, the electrolytes undergo ionization, which leads to lowering of vapour pressure.
65. (d) : The number of moles of ions produced by 1 mol of ionic compound \(=i\)
Applying, \(\Delta T_{f}=i \times K_{f} \times m\)
\(0.00732=i \times 1.86 \times 0.002\)
\(\Rightarrow i=\frac{0.00732}{1.86 \times 0.002}=1.96 \approx 2\)
66. (b) : \(\mathrm{HX} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{X}^{-}\)
\[
1-\alpha \quad \alpha \quad \alpha
\]

Total \(=1+\alpha\)
\(\therefore \quad i=1+\alpha=1+0.2=1.2\)
\(\Delta T_{f}=i \times K_{f} \times m=1.2 \times 1.86 \times 0.5=1.116 \mathrm{~K} \approx 1.12 \mathrm{~K}\)
67. (c) : Since \(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3}\) gives maximum number of ions on dissociation, therefore it will have the lowest freezing point.
\[
\Delta T_{f}=i K_{f} \cdot m
\]
68. (b) : \(\mathrm{K}_{3}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right] \rightleftharpoons 3 \mathrm{~K}^{+}+\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]^{3-}\) and
\(\mathrm{Al}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Al}^{3+}+3 \mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}\)
Since both \(\mathrm{Al}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3}\) and \(\mathrm{K}_{3}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]\) give the same number of ions, therefore they have the same van't Hoff factor.
69. (c) : In solution, \(\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}\) gives three ions, KCl gives two ions while glucose and urea are covalent molecules so they do not undergo ionisation. Since osmotic pressure is a colligative property and it depends upon the number of solute particles (ions), therefore, 0.1 M solution of \(\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}\) exhibits the highest osmotic pressure.
70. (a): Here, \(\Delta T_{f}=i \times K_{f} \times m\)
van't Hoff factor, \(i=2\) for NaCl , so conc. \(=0.02\), which is maximum in the present case.
Hence, \(\Delta T_{f}\) is maximum or freezing point is minimum in 0.01 m NaCl .

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (a) : \(E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}=E_{\text {cathode }}^{\circ}-E_{\text {anode }}^{\circ}\)
\[
=(+1.33)-(-0.44)=+1.77 \mathrm{~V}
\]
2. (b) : Higher the value of \(E^{\circ}{ }_{\text {red }}\), stronger is the oxidising power. Thus, the decreasing order of reducing power of the metal is \(\mathrm{K}>\mathrm{Al}>\mathrm{Cr}>\mathrm{Ag}\).
3. (c) \(: E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}=E_{\text {O.P. }}^{\circ}+E_{\text {R.P. }}^{\circ}=0.76+0.34=1.10 \mathrm{~V}\)
4. (a) : Less positive the value of reduction potential, stronger will be the reducing agent thus, \(\mathrm{I}^{-}\)is strongest reducing agent. More positive, the value of reduction potential shows good oxidising properties thus, strongest oxidising agent is \(\mathrm{F}_{2}\).
5. (c) : More negative the value of reduction potential, stronger will be the reducing agent.
So, \(Z(-3.0 \mathrm{~V})>X(-1.2 \mathrm{~V})>Y(+0.5 \mathrm{~V})\)
6 . (b) : \(E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}=E_{\text {cathode }}^{\circ}-E_{\text {anode }}^{\circ}\)
\[
=0.15-(-0.74)=0.15+0.74=0.89 \mathrm{~V}
\]
7. (c) : Since the reduction potential of \(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\) is greater than that of \(\mathrm{I}_{2} / \mathrm{I}^{-}, \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\) will be reduced and \(\mathrm{I}^{-}\)will be oxidised.
\[
2 \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+2 \mathrm{I}^{-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+\mathrm{I}_{2}
\]
8. (d) : EMF of a cell = Reduction potential of cathode
- Reduction potential of anode
\(=\) Reduction potential of cathode +
Oxidation potential of anode
= Oxidation potential of anode -
Oxidation potential of cathode.
9. (a) : \(\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]^{3-} \rightarrow\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]^{4-}, E^{\circ}=+0.35 \mathrm{~V}\)
\[
\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} ; E^{\circ}=+0.77 \mathrm{~V}
\]

Higher the +ve reduction potential, stronger will be the oxidising agent. Oxidising agent oxidises other compounds and gets itself reduced easily. Thus, \(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\) is the strongest oxidising agent.
10. (a) : From the given expression :

At anode : \(A \longrightarrow A^{+}+e^{-}\)(oxidation)
At cathode : \(B^{+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow B\) (reduction)
Overall reaction is : \(A+B^{+} \longrightarrow A^{+}+B\)
11. (d) \(: \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe} ; E^{\circ}=-0.441 \mathrm{~V}\)
\(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} ; E^{\circ}=0.771 \mathrm{~V}\)
\(\mathrm{Fe}+2 \mathrm{Fe}^{3+} \longrightarrow 3 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} ; E^{\circ}=\) ?
To get the above equation, (ii) \(\times 2\) - (i)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& 2 \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} ; E^{\circ}=0.771 \mathrm{~V} \\
& -\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}-2 e^{-} \longrightarrow-\mathrm{Fe} ; E^{\circ}=+0.441 \mathrm{~V} \\
& 2 \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+\mathrm{Fe} \longrightarrow 3 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} ; E^{\circ}=1.212 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
\]
12. (b) : \(E_{\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} / \mathrm{Fe}}^{\circ}=-0.44 \mathrm{~V}\)
\[
E_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}^{\circ}=+0.77 \mathrm{~V}
\]

If a cell is constructed combining these two electrodes oxidation occurs at \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} / \mathrm{Fe}\) electrode.
At anode: \(\mathrm{Fe} \rightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 e^{-}\)
At cathode : \(\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+e^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right] \times 2\)
Cell reaction : \(\mathrm{Fe}+2 \mathrm{Fe}^{3+} \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\)

If \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}, \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\) and Fe blocks are kept together then \(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\) reacts with Fe to yield \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\) i.e., concentration of \(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\) is decreased and that of \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\) is increased.
13. (d) : \(E_{\mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}=+0.76 \mathrm{~V}\)
\(E_{\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}=0.44 \mathrm{~V} \Rightarrow E^{\circ}{ }_{\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}{ }^{2+}{ }_{\mathrm{Fe}}=-0.44 \mathrm{~V}\)
\(E^{\circ}{ }_{\text {cell }}=E^{\circ}{ }_{\text {O.P. }}+E^{\circ}{ }_{\text {R.P. }}=+0.76-0.44=+0.32 \mathrm{~V}\)
14. (d) : Since it is a concentration cell and the concentration of \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ions in two electrolyte solutions \(\left(\mathrm{HCl}\right.\) and \(\left.\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\right)\) are different i.e., pH of 0.1 M HCl and \(0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\) is not same, therefore e.m.f. of this cell will not be zero.
15. (b) : More positive or less negative the reduction potential value, the stronger is the oxidising agent.
16. (c) : A stronger oxidising agent \(\left(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right)\) displaces a weaker oxidising agent \(\left(\mathrm{Br}_{2}\right)\) from its salt solution.
\[
2 \mathrm{KBr}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{KCl}+\mathrm{Br}_{2}
\]
17. (b) : \(\mathrm{Tl}^{3+}\) acts as an oxidising agent and not reducing agent.
18. (d) : \(\Delta_{r} G=-n F E_{\text {cell }}\)
\(E_{\text {cell }}\) is an intensive parameter but \(\Delta_{r} G\) is an extensive thermodynamic property and the value of \(\Delta_{r} G\) depends on \(n\).
19. (a) : \(E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}=E_{\text {cathode }}^{\circ}-E_{\text {anode }}^{\circ}=+1.510-1.223=+0.287 \mathrm{~V}\)

As \(E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}\) is positive, hence the reaction is feasible.
20. (d) : The values of standard reduction potential of Cu and Ag suggest that Cu would undergo oxidation (lower reduction potential) and Ag would undergoes reduction (higher reduction potential). Hence, the cell reaction will be
\(\mathrm{Cu}+2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Ag}\)
21. (c) : According to Nernst equation,
\(E=E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}-\frac{0.059}{n} \log \frac{\left[\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]^{2}}\)
\(E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}=1.05\) (Given)
Note : Please read 10.5 as 1.05 in question.
\(E=1.05-\frac{0.059}{2} \log \frac{(0.001)}{(0.001)^{2}}\)
\(=1.05-\frac{0.059}{2} \log 10^{3}=1.05-\frac{0.059 \times 3}{2}\)
\(=1.05-0.0885=0.9615 \mathrm{~V}\)
22. (b) : The standard Gibbs' energy, \(\left(\Delta G^{\circ}\right)=-n F E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}\).

Value of \(n=2\)
\(\therefore \quad \Delta G^{\circ}=-2 \times 96500 \times 0.24=-46320 \mathrm{~J}\)
\[
=-46.32 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}
\]
23. (d) : According to Nernst equation,
\[
E_{\text {cell }}=E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}-\frac{0.059}{n} \log Q_{c}
\]

At equilibrium \(E_{\text {cell }}=0, \quad \therefore Q_{c}=K_{c}\)
\(E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}=\frac{0.059}{n} \log K_{c} \Rightarrow 0.59=\frac{0.059}{1} \log K_{c}\)
\(K_{c}=\operatorname{antilog} 10 \Rightarrow K_{c}=1 \times 10^{10}\)
24. (b) : \(E_{\text {cell }}=E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}-\frac{0.059}{n} \log \frac{\left[\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}\right]}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& E_{1}=E^{\circ}-\frac{0.059}{2} \log \frac{0.01}{1} \\
& E_{1}=E^{\circ}-\frac{0.059}{2}(-2)=E^{\circ}+0.059 \\
& E_{2}=E^{\circ}-\frac{0.059}{2} \log \frac{1}{0.01}=E^{\circ}-0.059
\end{aligned}
\]

Hence, \(E_{1}>E_{2}\).
25. (a) : \(\Delta G^{\circ}=-n F E^{\circ}{ }_{\text {cell }}\)

If \(E^{\circ}{ }_{\text {cell }}=-\) ve then \(\Delta G^{\circ}=+\) ve i.e.; \(\Delta G^{\circ}>0\).
\(\Delta G^{\circ}=-n R T \log K_{\text {eq }}\)
For \(\Delta G^{\circ}=+\mathrm{ve}, K_{\mathrm{eq}}=-\) ve i.e., \(K_{\mathrm{eq}}<1\).
26. (c) : \(\mathrm{pH}=7\) for water.
\[
\begin{aligned}
& -\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=7 \Rightarrow\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=10^{-7} \\
& 2 \mathrm{H}_{(\mathrm{aq})}^{+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2(\mathrm{~g})}
\end{aligned}
\]
\(E_{\text {cell }}=E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}-\frac{0.0591}{2} \log \frac{P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2}}\)
\(0=0-\frac{0.0591}{2} \log \frac{P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}}{\left(10^{-7}\right)^{2}}\)
\(\log \frac{P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}}{\left(10^{-7}\right)^{2}}=0 \Rightarrow \frac{P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}}{\left(10^{-7}\right)^{2}}=1\)
\([\because \log 1=0]\)
\(p_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}=10^{-14} \mathrm{~atm}\)
27. (d) \(: \underset{1 \mathrm{~atm}}{\mathrm{H}_{2}} \longrightarrow \underset{10^{-10}}{2 \mathrm{H}^{+}}+2 e^{-}\)
\(E_{\mathrm{H}_{2} / \mathrm{H}^{+}}=0-\frac{0.059}{2} \log \frac{\left(10^{-10}\right)^{2}}{1}\)
\(E_{\mathrm{H}_{2} / \mathrm{H}^{+}}=+0.59 \mathrm{~V}\)
28. (d) : \(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mn} ; E^{\circ}=-1.18 \mathrm{~V}\)
\[
2 \mathrm{Mn}^{2+} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Mn}^{3+}+2 e^{-} ; E^{\circ}=-1.51 \mathrm{~V}
\]

By adding equation (i) and (ii), we get equation for the cell,
\[
3 \mathrm{Mn}^{2+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mn}+2 \mathrm{Mn}^{3+} ; E^{\circ}=-2.69 \mathrm{~V}
\]

Since the \(E^{\circ}\) value is negative, so the process is non-spontaneous as \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) is positive.
29. (c) : \(\Delta G^{\circ}=-n F E^{\circ}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& F=96500, \Delta G^{\circ}=+960 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \\
& \frac{2}{3} \mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \rightarrow \frac{4}{3} \mathrm{Al}+\mathrm{O}_{2}
\end{aligned}
\]

Total number of Al atoms in \(\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}=\frac{2}{3} \times 2=\frac{4}{3}\)
\(\mathrm{Al}^{3+}+3 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Al}\)
As \(3 e^{-}\)change occur for each Al-atom
\(\therefore \quad\) Total \(n=\frac{4}{3} \times 3=4\)
\[
E^{\circ}=-\frac{\Delta G^{\circ}}{n F}=-\frac{960 \times 1000}{4 \times 96500} \Rightarrow E^{\circ}=-2.48 \approx-2.5 \mathrm{~V}
\]
30. (b) : \(\mathrm{Cu}_{(a q)}^{2+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}_{(a q)}^{+} ; E_{1}{ }^{\circ}=0.15 \mathrm{~V}\)
\(\mathrm{Cu}_{(a q)}^{+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}_{(s)} ; E_{2}{ }^{\circ}=0.50 \mathrm{~V}\)
\(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu} ; E^{\circ}=\) ?

Now, \(\Delta G^{\circ}=\Delta G_{1}{ }^{\circ}+\Delta G_{2}{ }^{\circ}\)
or, \(-n F E^{\circ}=-n_{1} F E_{1}{ }^{\circ}-n_{2} F E_{2}{ }^{\circ}\)
or, \(E^{\circ}=\frac{n_{1} E_{1}^{\circ}+n_{2} E_{2}^{\circ}}{n}=\frac{1 \times 0.15+1 \times 0.50}{2}=0.325 \mathrm{~V}\)
31. (a) : The cell reaction can be written as
\[
\mathrm{Cu}+2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Ag}
\]

We know, \(\Delta G^{\circ}=-n F E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& =-2 \times 96500 \times 0.46=-88780 \mathrm{~J} \\
& =-88.78 \mathrm{~kJ} \approx-89 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
\]
32. (d) : Given,
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu} ; E_{1}^{\circ}=0.337 \mathrm{~V} \\
& \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{+} ; E_{2}^{\circ}=0.153 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
\]

The required reaction is
\[
\mathrm{Cu}^{+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu} ; E_{3}^{\circ}=?
\]

Applying, \(\Delta G^{\circ}=-n F E^{\circ}, \Delta G_{3}^{\circ}=\Delta G_{1}^{\circ}-\Delta G_{2}^{\circ}\)
\[
-\left(n_{3} F E_{3}^{\circ}\right)=-\left(n_{3} F E_{1}^{\circ}\right)-\left(n_{3} F E_{2}^{\circ}\right)
\]
or \(\quad E_{3}^{\circ}=2 \times E_{1}^{\circ}-E_{2}^{\circ}\)
or \(E_{3}^{\circ}=(2 \times 0.337)-0.153=0.52 \mathrm{~V}\)
33. (a) : \(\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12(g)}+8 \mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \longrightarrow 5 \mathrm{CO}_{2(g)}+6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G^{\circ}= & {[(-394.4 \times 5)+(-237.2 \times 6)]-[(-8.2)+(8 \times 0)] } \\
& =-3387 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that the standard free energy change of elementary substances is taken as zero.
For the fuel cell, the complete cell reaction is :
\[
\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12(g)}+8 \mathrm{O}_{2(g)} \longrightarrow 5 \mathrm{CO}_{2(g)}+6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)}
\]
which is the combination of the following two half reactions :
\(\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{12(g)}+10 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)} \longrightarrow 5 \mathrm{CO}_{2(g)}+32 \mathrm{H}^{+}+32 e^{-}\)and \(8 \mathrm{O}_{2(\mathrm{~g})}+32 \mathrm{H}^{+}+32 e^{-} \longrightarrow 16 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)}\)
Therefore, the number of electrons exchanged is 32 here, i.e., \(n=32\).
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta G^{\circ}=-n F E^{\circ} \\
& -3387 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}=-32 \times 96500 \mathrm{~J} / \text { Volt } \times E^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, \(E^{\circ}=1.0968 \mathrm{~V}\)
34. (c) : For a cell reaction in equilibrium at 298 K ,
\[
E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}=\frac{0.0591}{n} \log K_{c}
\]
where, \(K_{c}=\) equilibrium constant, \(n=\) number of electrons involved in the electrochemical cell reaction.
Given, \(E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}=0.46 \mathrm{~V}, n=2\)
\(\therefore \quad 0.46=\frac{0.0591}{2} \times \log K_{c}\) or, \(\log K_{c}=\frac{2 \times 0.46}{0.0591}=15.57\)
or, \(\quad K_{c}=3.7 \times 10^{15} \approx 4 \times 10^{15}\)
35. (d) : \(E=E^{\circ}-\frac{0.0591}{n} \log _{10} Q\) at \(25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)

At equilibrium, \(E=0, Q=K\)
\[
0=E^{\circ}-\frac{0.0591}{n} \log _{10} K
\]
or, \(K=\operatorname{antilog}\left[\frac{n E^{\circ}}{0.0591}\right]\)
or, \(K=\operatorname{antilog}\left[\frac{2 \times 0.295}{0.0591}\right]=\operatorname{antilog}\left[\frac{0.590}{0.0591}\right]\)
\(=\operatorname{antilog} 10=1 \times 10^{10}\)
36. (a) : \(\Delta G^{\circ}=-n F E^{\circ}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& E^{\circ}=\frac{\Delta G^{\circ}}{-n F}=\frac{-827000}{-4 \times 96500}=2.14 \mathrm{~V} \\
& \left(\because 1 \mathrm{Al} \equiv 3 e^{-}, \frac{4}{3} \mathrm{Al}=\frac{4}{3} \times 3 e^{-}=4 e^{-}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]
37. (c) : For the reaction, \(2 \mathrm{Cu}^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+\mathrm{Cu}\)
the cathode is \(\mathrm{Cu}^{+} / \mathrm{Cu}\) and anode is \(\mathrm{Cu}^{+} / \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}\).
Given, \(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu} ; E_{1}^{\circ}=0.34 \mathrm{~V}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{+} ; E_{2}^{\circ}=0 \cdot 15 \mathrm{~V} \\
& \mathrm{Cu}^{+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu} ; \quad E_{3}^{\circ}=?
\end{aligned}
\]

Now \(\Delta G_{1}^{\circ}=-n F E_{1}^{\circ}=-2 \times 0.34 \times F=-0.68 F\)
\[
\Delta G_{2}^{\circ}=-1 \times 0 \cdot 15 \times F, \Delta G_{3}^{\circ}=-1 \times E_{3}^{\circ} \times F,
\]

Again \(\Delta G_{1}^{\circ}=\Delta G_{2}^{\circ}+\Delta G_{3}^{\circ}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad-0.68 F=-0.15 F-E_{3}^{\circ} \times F \\
& \Rightarrow \quad E_{3}^{\circ}=0.68-0.15=0.53 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
\]

As, \(E_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}=E_{\text {cathode }\left(\mathrm{Cu}^{+} / \mathrm{Cu}\right)}^{\circ}-E_{\text {anode }\left(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+} / \mathrm{Cu}^{+}\right)}^{\circ}\)
\[
=0.53-0.15=0.38 \mathrm{~V}
\]
38. (d) : Nernst equation is
\[
\begin{aligned}
E & =E^{\circ}-\frac{0.059}{2} \log K \\
\Rightarrow \quad E^{\circ} & =\frac{0.059}{2} \log K \quad(E=0 \text { at equilibrium condition }) \\
\Rightarrow \quad 1.1 & =\frac{0.059}{2} \log K \Rightarrow K=1.9 \times 10^{+37}
\end{aligned}
\]
39. (d) : The given equation is applicable only to strong electrolytes. For strong electrolytes, \(\Lambda_{m}\) increases slowly with dilution and thus is, represented by the given equation. The value of the constant ' \(A\) ' for a given solvent and temperature depends on the type of electrolyte, i.e., the charge on the cation and anion produced on the dissociation of the electrolyte in the solution. Value of constant ' \(A\) ' is same for both \(\mathrm{BaCl}_{2}\) and \(\mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\).
40. (a) : Given, \(\mathrm{K}=0.0210 \mathrm{ohm}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}, R=60 \mathrm{ohm}\)
\(\kappa=\frac{1}{R} \times \frac{l}{a}\) (where \(\frac{l}{a}=\) cell constant)
or \(\quad 0.0210=\frac{1}{60} \times \frac{l}{a}\)
or \(\quad \frac{l}{a}=60 \times 0.0210=1.26 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\)
41. (c) : \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}}^{\infty}=\Lambda_{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COONa}}^{\circ}+\Lambda_{\mathrm{HCl}}^{\circ}-\Lambda_{\mathrm{NaCl}}^{\circ}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& =91.0+426.16-126.45 \\
& =390.71 \mathrm{~S} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
\]
42. (d) : \(\Lambda_{m\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\right)}^{\circ}=\lambda_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\circ}+\lambda_{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}}^{\circ}\)
\[
=350+50=400 \mathrm{~S} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\]

Degree of dissociation, \(\alpha=\frac{\Lambda_{m}^{c}}{\Lambda_{m}^{\circ}}=\frac{20}{400}=0.05\)
So, dissociation constant,
\[
\begin{aligned}
K_{a} & =c \alpha^{2}(\text { for weak electrolytes }) \\
& =0.007(0.05)^{2}=1.75 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
\]
43. (d) : According to Kohlrausch's law,
\(\Lambda_{m}^{\circ}\) for \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}=\lambda_{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}}+\lambda_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\circ}\)
\(\Lambda^{\circ}\) for \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}=2 \lambda_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\circ}+\lambda_{\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}}^{\circ}=x \mathrm{~S} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
\(\Lambda^{\circ}\) for \(\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}=2 \lambda_{\mathrm{K}^{+}}^{\circ}+\lambda_{\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}}^{\circ}=y \mathrm{~S} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
\(\Lambda^{\circ}\) for \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOK}=\lambda_{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}}+\lambda_{\mathrm{K}^{+}}^{\circ}=z \mathrm{~S} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)

On adding equation (i) and \(2 \times\) (iii) and subtracting (ii), we get \(2 \lambda_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\circ}+\lambda_{\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}}^{\circ}+2 \lambda^{\circ} \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}+2 \lambda_{\mathrm{K}^{+}}^{\circ}-2 \lambda_{\mathrm{K}^{+}}^{\circ}-\lambda_{\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}}^{\circ}=x+2 z-y\)
\(2 \lambda_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\circ}+2 \lambda_{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}}^{\circ}=x+2 z-y\)
\(\lambda_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\circ}+\lambda_{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}}^{\circ}=\frac{(x-y)}{2}+z\)

\]
45. (a) : Degree of dissociation

\(\alpha=\frac{9.54 \Omega^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}}{238 \Omega^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}}=0.04008=4.008 \%\)

\(\Lambda^{\circ} \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COONa}=91.0 \mathrm{~S} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
\(\Lambda^{\circ}{ }_{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}}=\Lambda^{\circ}{ }_{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COONa}}+\Lambda^{\circ}{ }_{\mathrm{HCl}}-\Lambda^{\circ}{ }_{\mathrm{NaCl}}\)

\]
48. (a) : Strong electrolytes are completely ionised at all concentrations. On increasing dilution, the no. of ions remains the same but the ionic mobility increases and the equivalent conductance increases.
49. (b) : At infinite dilution, when dissociation is complete, each ion makes a definite contribution towards molar conductance of the electrolyte irrespective of the nature of the other ion with which it is associated.
Hence, \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{Al}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3}}^{\circ}=\lambda_{\mathrm{Al}^{3+}}^{\circ}+\lambda_{\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}}^{\circ}\)
50. (d) : Given, \(\Lambda=8 \mathrm{mhocm} \mathrm{cm}^{2}, \Lambda^{\infty}=400 \mathrm{mhocm} \mathrm{cm}^{2}\)

Degree of dissociation, \(\alpha=\frac{\Lambda}{\Lambda^{\infty}} \Rightarrow \alpha=\frac{8}{400}=2 \times 10^{-2}\)
Dissociation constant, \(K=C \alpha^{2}\)
Given, \(C=M / 32\)
\(\therefore \quad K=\frac{1}{32} \times 2 \times 10^{-2} \times 2 \times 10^{-2}=1.25 \times 10^{-5}\)
51. (a) : At infinite dilution, when dissociation is complete each ion makes a definite contribution towards molar conductance of the electrolyte irrespective of the nature of the other ion with which it is associated and that the molar conductance of any electrolyte at infinite dilution is given by the sum of the contributions of two ions. This is called Kohlrausch's law.
\(\Lambda_{m}^{\infty}=\Lambda_{+}^{\infty}+\Lambda_{-}^{\infty}\),
where, \(\Lambda_{+}^{\infty}\) and \(\Lambda_{-}^{\infty}\) are molar ionic conductance at infinite dilution for cation and anion, respectively.
52. (a) : \(\lambda_{\infty}=\frac{1}{n_{+}} \lambda_{+}^{\infty}+\frac{1}{n_{-}} \lambda_{-}^{\infty}\)

So, \(\lambda_{\infty}\left(\mathrm{BaCl}_{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2} \times \lambda_{\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}}^{\infty}+\frac{1}{1} \times \lambda_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\infty}\)
\[
=\frac{1}{2} \times 127+76=63 \cdot 5+76=139 \cdot 5
\]
53. (b) : \(\kappa=0.012 \mathrm{ohm}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\)
\(R=55 \mathrm{ohm} \Rightarrow C=\frac{1}{R}=\frac{1}{55} \mathrm{ohm}^{-1}\)
Cell Constant \(\left(\frac{l}{a}\right)=\frac{\text { Specific Conductance }}{\text { Conductance }}\)
\[
=\frac{0.012}{1 / 55}=55 \times 0.012=0.66 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}
\]
54. (a) : Conductivity of heat in metals is due to the presence of free electrons, which move due to increase in temperature.
55. (a) : \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}+2 e^{-}\)
\(\therefore \quad\) No. of Faradays required for one \(\mathrm{mol}=2 \mathrm{~F}\) (A-II)
\[
\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+5 e^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}
\]
\(\therefore \quad\) No. of Faradays required for one \(\mathrm{mol}=5 \mathrm{~F}\) (B-IV)
\[
\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ca}
\]
\(\therefore \quad\) No. of Faradays required for \(1.5 \mathrm{~mol}=1.5 \times 2=3 \mathrm{~F}(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{I})\)
\[
\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+e^{-}
\]

No. of Faradays required for one \(\mathrm{mol}=1\) F (D-III)
56. (b) : Given,

Current \((I)=9.6487 \mathrm{~A}\), Time \((t)=100\) seconds
\(1 \mathrm{~F}=96487 \mathrm{C}\)
Reaction : \(\mathrm{Cu}_{(a q)}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}_{(s)}\)
Here, 2 electrons are exchanged, so valency factor \((n)=2\)
Applying Faraday's first law,
\(W=Z I t\left(\because Z=\frac{\text { Equivalent weight }}{F}=\frac{63}{2 \times 96487}\right)\)
So, \(W=\frac{63 \times 9.6487 \times 100}{2 \times 96487}=0.315 \mathrm{~g}\)
57. (b) : During electrolysis of dilute sulphuric acid the following reaction takes place at anode.
\(2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)} \rightarrow \mathrm{O}_{2(g)}+4 \mathrm{H}^{+}{ }_{(a q)}+4 e^{-} ; E^{\circ}{ }_{\text {cell }}=+1.23 \mathrm{~V}\)
i.e., \(\mathrm{O}_{2(g)}\) will be liberated at anode.
58. (a) : \(\mathrm{Ca}_{(\text {aq })}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ca}_{(\text {s })}\)
\[
\begin{array}{lc}
2 \mathrm{~F} & (1 \text { mole }=40 \mathrm{~g}) \\
1 \mathrm{~F} & 20 \mathrm{~g}
\end{array}
\]

Thus, one Faraday is required to produce 20 g of calcium from molten \(\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}\).
59. (b) : During the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, At cathode : \(2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na}\)

At anode : \(2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_{2}+2 e^{-}\)
Net reaction : \(2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\)
According to Faraday's first law of electrolysis,
\(w=Z \times I \times t\)
\(w=\frac{E}{96500} \times I \times t\)
No. of moles of \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\) gas × Mol. wt. of \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\) gas
\(=\frac{\text { Eq. wt. of } \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \text { gas × } \times I \times t}{96500}\)
\(0.10 \times 71=\frac{35.5 \times 3 \times t}{96500}\)
\(t=\frac{0.10 \times 71 \times 96500}{35.5 \times 3}=6433.33 \mathrm{sec}\)
\(t=\frac{6433.33}{60} \mathrm{~min}=107.22 \mathrm{~min} \approx 110 \mathrm{~min}\)
60. (c) : \(Q=I \times t\)
\(\mathrm{Q}=1 \times 60=60 \mathrm{C}\)
Now, \(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C} \equiv 1\) electron
\(\therefore \quad 60 \mathrm{C} \equiv \frac{60}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}=3.75 \times 10^{20}\) electrons
61. (c) : The oxidation reaction is
\[
\begin{gathered}
\stackrel{+6}{\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{2-}} \longrightarrow \underset{0.1 \mathrm{~mol}}{+7} \longrightarrow \mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+e^{-} \\
0.1 \mathrm{~mol}
\end{gathered}
\]
\[
Q=0.1 \times F=0.1 \times 96500 \mathrm{C}=9650 \mathrm{C}
\]
62. (d) : According to Faraday's second law,
\[
\frac{W_{\mathrm{Ag}}}{E_{\mathrm{Ag}}}=\frac{W_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{E_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}} \text { or } \frac{W_{\mathrm{Ag}}}{108}=\frac{\frac{5600}{22400} \times 32}{8}
\]
or \(\frac{W_{\mathrm{Ag}}}{108}=\frac{8}{8} \Rightarrow W_{\mathrm{Ag}}=108 \mathrm{~g}\)
63. (b) : \(w=\frac{I t E}{96500}\)
\[
=\frac{10 \times 109 \times 60 \times 59}{96500 \times 2}=19.99 \approx 20 \mathrm{~g}
\]
64. (a) : Applying \(E=Z \times 96500\)
\(\frac{27}{3}=Z \times 96500 \Rightarrow Z=\frac{9}{96500}\)
Now applying the formula, \(w=Z \times I \times t\)
\(w=\frac{9}{96500} \times 4 \times 10^{4} \times 6 \times 60 \times 60=8.1 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~g}\)
65. (d) : We know that,

1 Faraday charge liberates 1 eq. of substance.
This is the Faraday law.
eq. wt. of \(\mathrm{Al}=\frac{27}{3}=9\)
No. of eq. of \(\mathrm{Al}=\frac{\text { wt. of } \mathrm{Al}}{\text { eq. } \mathrm{wt} .}=\frac{4.5}{9}=0.5\)

No. of Faradays required \(=0.5\)
⇒ No. of eq. of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\) produced \(=0.5\) eq.
Volume occupied by 1 eq. of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}=\frac{22.4}{2}=11.2 \mathrm{~L}\)
⇒ Volume occupied by 0.5 eq. of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}=11.2 \times 0.5 =5.6 \mathrm{~L}\) at STP
66. (b) : When sodium chloride is dissolved in water, it ionises as \(\mathrm{NaCl} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\).
Water also dissociates as : \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)
During passing of electric current through this solution using platinum electrode, \(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\)and \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ions move towards cathode. However, only \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ions are discharged more readily than \(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\)ions because of their low discharge potential (in the electromotive series hydrogen is lower than sodium). These \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\) ions gain electrons and change into neutral atoms.
At cathode \(\mathrm{H}^{+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H}+\mathrm{H} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}\)
\(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)and \(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)ions move towards anode. \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)ions lose electrons and change into neutral atom.
At anode, \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}-e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}, \mathrm{Cl}+\mathrm{Cl} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\)
If mercury is used as cathode, \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ions are not discharged at mercury cathode because mercury has a high hydrogen overvoltage. \(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\)ions are discharged at the cathode in preference to \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ions, yielding sodium, which dissolves in mercury to form sodium amalgam.
At cathode : \(\mathrm{Na}^{+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}\)
67. (d) : Current \((I)=5\) ampere and time \((t)=40\) minutes
\[
=2400 \text { seconds. }
\]

Amount of electricity passed \((Q)=I \times t\)
\[
=5 \times 2400=12000 \mathrm{C}
\]

Now, \(\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}(1\) mole \(=65.39 \mathrm{~g})\)

Since, two charges (i.e., \(2 \times 96500 \mathrm{C}\) ) deposits 65.39 g of zinc, therefore 12000 C will deposit
\(=\frac{65.39 \times 12000}{2 \times 96500}=4.065 \mathrm{~g}\) of zinc
68. (d) : Sodium is obtained by electrolytic reduction of its chloride. Melting point of chloride of sodium is high so in order to lower its melting point, calcium chloride is added to it.
69. (b) : \(\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}\)
\(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)
At cathode : \(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}\)
At anode : \(4 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{O}_{2}+4 e^{-}\)
70. (c)
71. (b) : The thermal efficiency, \(\eta\) of a fuel conversion device is the amount of useful energy produced relative to the change in enthalpy, \(\Delta H\) between the product and feed streams.
\(\eta=\frac{\text { useful energy }}{\Delta H}\)
In an ideal case of an electrochemical converter, such as a fuel cell, the change in Gibb's free energy, \(\Delta G\) of the reaction is available as useful electric energy at that temperature of the conversion.
Hence, \(\eta_{\text {ideal }}=\frac{\Delta G}{\Delta H}\)
72. (d) : Reduction potential values of \(E_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{\circ}{ }^{2+/ \mathrm{Zn}}=-0.76 \mathrm{~V}\) and \(E^{\circ} \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} / \mathrm{Fe}=-0.44 \mathrm{~V}\)
Thus, due to higher negative electrode potential value of zinc than iron, iron cannot be coated on zinc.
73. (b) : The most convenient method to protect the bottom of the ship made of iron is white tin plating preventing the build up of barnacles.
74. (b)

\]

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (c) : \(3 A \rightarrow 2 B\)
\(r=-\frac{1}{3} \frac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t}=+\frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta[B]}{\Delta t} \Rightarrow \frac{\Delta[B]}{\Delta t}=-\frac{2}{3} \frac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t}\)
2. (d) : For the given chemical reaction,

Rate of reaction \(=-\frac{d\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]}{d t}=-\frac{1}{3} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]}{d t}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]}{d t}\)
3. (b) : For the reaction, \(2 \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5} \rightarrow 4 \mathrm{NO}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2}\)
\(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}\right]}{d t}=+\frac{1}{4} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]}{d t}=+\frac{d\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}{d t}\)
\(\frac{1}{2} k=\frac{1}{4} k^{\prime}=k^{\prime \prime}, k^{\prime}=2 k ; k^{\prime \prime}=\frac{1}{2} k\)
4. (b) : \(\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5(g)} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{NO}_{2(g)}+1 / 2 \mathrm{O}_{2(g)}\)

For the given reaction the rate is written as
\[
\frac{-d\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}\right]}{d t}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]}{d t}=\frac{2 d\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}{d t}
\]

Given that \(\frac{-d\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}\right]}{d t}=6.25 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\)
\(\therefore \frac{d\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]}{d t}=2 \times 6.25 \times 10^{-3}=1.25 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\)
and \(\frac{d\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}{d t}=\frac{6.25 \times 10^{-3}}{2}=3.125 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{molL}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\)
5. (d) : For reaction, \(\mathrm{N}_{2}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}\)

Rate \(=\frac{1}{2} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]}{d t}=-\frac{1}{3} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]}{d t}=-\frac{d\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]}{d t}\)
Given, \(\frac{d\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]}{d t}=2 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\)
\(\therefore-\frac{d\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{d t}}{d t}=\frac{3}{2} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]}{d t}=\frac{3}{2} \times 2 \times 10^{-4}\)
\(\Rightarrow-\frac{d\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]}{d t}=3 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\)
6. (d) : For the given reaction,
\(\mathrm{BrO}_{3}{ }^{-}{ }_{(a q)}+5 \mathrm{Br}^{-}{ }_{(a q)}+6 \mathrm{H}^{+}{ }_{(a q)} \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{Br}_{2(l)}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(l)}\)
Rate of reaction in terms of \(\mathrm{Br}_{2}\) and \(\mathrm{Br}^{-}\)is,
Rate \(=\frac{1}{3} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{Br}_{2}\right]}{d t}=-\frac{1}{5} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{Br}^{-}\right]}{d t} \quad \therefore \frac{d\left[\mathrm{Br}_{2}\right]}{d t}=-\frac{3}{5} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{Br}^{-}\right]}{d t}\)
7. (c) : \(\mathrm{N}_{2(g)}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3(g)}\)

Rate \(=\frac{-d\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]}{d t}=-\frac{d\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]}{3 d t}=+\frac{d\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]}{2 d t}\)
Hence, \(+\frac{d\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]}{d t}=-\frac{2}{3} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]}{d t}\)
8. (b) : \(2 A+B \rightarrow 3 C+D\)
rate \(=\frac{-d[A]}{2 d t}=-\frac{d[B]}{d t}=\frac{d[C]}{3 d t}=\frac{d[D]}{d t}\)
Negative sign shows the decrease in concentration.
9. (b) \(: 3 A \rightarrow 2 B\)

Rate of the reaction \(=\frac{1}{2} \frac{d[B]}{d t}=-\frac{1}{3} \frac{d[A]}{d t}\)
\(\Rightarrow \frac{d[B]}{d t}=-\frac{2}{3} \frac{d[A]}{d t}\)
10. (a) : Rate of reaction \(=-\frac{1}{3} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{Br}^{-}\right]}{d t}=+\frac{1}{5} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{Br}_{2}\right]}{d t}\).
\(\Rightarrow \quad \frac{d\left[\mathrm{Br}^{-}\right]}{d t}=-\frac{3}{5} \frac{d\left[\mathrm{Br}_{2}\right]}{d t}\)
11. (b) : For \(\mathrm{H}_{2(g)}+\mathrm{I}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HI}_{(g)}\), the rate of reaction is
\[
-\frac{\Delta\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]}{\Delta t}=-\frac{\Delta\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]}{\Delta t}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta[\mathrm{HI}]}{\Delta t}
\]

Negative sign shows disappearance of reactant and positive sign shows the appearance of product.
12. (d) : \(r=k[A]^{-1 / 2}[B]^{3 / 2}\)

Order \(=-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{2}=\frac{2}{2}=1\)
13. (a) : \(r_{1}=k[A]^{2}[B]\)

Keeping conc. of \(B\) constant and tripling conc. of \(A\), new rate would be
\(r_{2}=k[3 A]^{2}[B]=9 k[A]^{2}[B]\)
\(\therefore \quad r_{2}=9 \times r_{1}\)
14. (c) : Note: Correct the reactions given in question as
\[
\begin{aligned}
& X_{2} \rightleftharpoons X+X \\
& X+Y_{2} \longrightarrow X Y+Y
\end{aligned}
\]
(slow)
Slow step is the rate determining step.
Rate \(=k[X]\left[Y_{2}\right]\)
Equilibrium constant for fast step, \(K=\frac{[X]^{2}}{\left[X_{2}\right]}\)
\([X]=\sqrt{K\left[X_{2}\right]}\)

By substituting [ \(X\) ] in equation (i), we get
Rate \(=k \sqrt{K\left[X_{2}\right]} \quad\left[Y_{2}\right]=k^{\prime}\left[X_{2}\right]^{1 / 2}\left[Y_{2}\right]\)
∴ Order of reaction \(=\frac{1}{2}+1=\frac{3}{2}=1.5\)
15. (a) : At low pressure, rate is proportional to the surface coverage and is of first order while at high pressure, it follows zero order kinetics due to complete coverage of surface area.
16. (c) : Reaction is of zero order as the unit of rate constant is \(\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{L}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\).
Concentration of \(B=k \times t=0.6 \times 10^{-3} \times 20 \times 60=0.72 \mathrm{M}\)
17. (c) : \(\operatorname{Rate}_{1}=k[A]^{2}[B]^{3}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Rate }_{2}=k[2 A]^{2}[2 B]^{3} \\
& \text { Rate }_{2}=32 k[A]^{2}[B]^{3}
\end{aligned}
\]
\(\therefore \quad\) Rate \(_{2}=32\left(\right.\) Rate \(\left._{1}\right)\)
18. (d) :

\begin{tabular}{ccc}
{\([A]\)} & {\([B]\)} & Rate \\
\(x\) & \(y\) & \(R\) \\
\(x\) & \(2 y\) & \(2 R\) \\
\(2 x\) & \(2 y\) & \(8 R\)
\end{tabular}

Let the rate law ; rate \(=k[A]^{a}[B]^{b}\)
From data given, \((x)^{a}(y)^{b}=R\)
\((x)^{a}(2 y)^{b}=2 R\)

Dividing eqn. (v) by (iv),
\[
\frac{(2 y)^{b}}{(y)^{b}}=\frac{2 R}{R} \Rightarrow(2)^{b}=2=2^{1}
\]

Thus, \(b=1\)
From data of (iii) experiment,
\[
(2 x)^{a}(2 y)^{b}=8 R
\]

From eqn. (v) and (vi),
\[
\frac{(2 x)^{a}}{(x)^{a}}=\frac{8 R}{2 R} \Rightarrow(2)^{a}=4=2^{2}
\]

Thus, \(a=2\). By replacing the values of \(a\) and \(b\) in rate law; rate \(=k[A]^{2}[B]\)
19. (d): Order of a reaction is not always whole number. It can be zero, or fractional also.
20. (a) \(:\) Rate \(=k[A]^{0}\)
\(\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{L}^{-1} s^{-1}=k\)
Thus, the unit of rate constant is \(\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{L}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\).
21. (d) : Let the rate of reaction be given by :
\[
\text { rate }=k[A]^{a}[B]^{b} .
\]

Now consider II and III from table where \([A]\) is constant.
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{7.2 \times 10^{-2}}{2.88 \times 10^{-1}}=\frac{[0.3]^{a}[0.2]^{b}}{[0.3]^{a}[0.4]^{b}} \\
& \frac{1}{4}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{b} \Rightarrow b=2
\end{aligned}
\]

Now consider I and IV,
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{6.0 \times 10^{-3}}{2.4 \times 10^{-2}}=\frac{[0.1]^{a}[0.1]^{b}}{[0.4]^{a}[0.1]^{b}} \\
& \frac{1}{4}=\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{a} \Rightarrow a=1 \\
& \text { Rate }=k[A][B]^{2}
\end{aligned}
\]
22. (a) : \(R=k[A]^{m}[B]^{n}\)
\(2 R=k[2 A]^{m}[B]^{n}\)
\(8 R=k[2 A]^{m}[2 B]^{n}\)
from (i), (ii) and (iii), \(m=1, n=2\)
So, rate \(=k[A][B]^{2}\)
23. (c) : From the first two experiments, it is clear that when concentration of \(\mathrm{Br}_{2}\) is doubled, the initial rate of disappearance of \(\mathrm{Br}_{2}\) remains unaltered. So, order of reaction with respect to \(\mathrm{Br}_{2}\) is zero. Thus, the probable rate law for the reaction will be : \(k\left[\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCH}_{3}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\)
24. (d) : The slow step is the rate determining step and it involves 1 molecule of \(\mathrm{H}_{2(g)}\) and 1 molecule of \(\mathrm{ICl}_{(g)}\). Hence, the rate will be, \(r=k\left[\mathrm{H}_{2(g)}\right]\left[\mathrm{ICl}_{(g)}\right]\)
i.e., the reaction is \(1^{\text {st }}\) order with respect to \(\mathrm{H}_{2(g)}\) and \(\mathrm{ICl}_{(g)}\).
25. (b) : Rate of reaction \(=k[A]^{\alpha}[B]^{\beta}\)
\(\alpha \rightarrow\) order of reaction w.r.t. \(A\)
\(\beta \rightarrow\) order of reaction w.r.t. \(B\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& r_{1}=k[A]^{\alpha}[B]^{\beta} \\
& r_{2}=r_{1} / 4=k[A]^{\alpha}[2 B]^{\beta} \\
\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}= & \frac{k[A]^{\alpha}[B]^{\beta}}{k[A]^{\alpha}[2 B]^{\beta}} \Rightarrow 4=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\beta} \Rightarrow \beta=-2
\end{aligned}
\]
26. (a) : \(A \rightarrow\) products

If \(-\frac{d x}{d t}=k\), it means \(-\frac{d x}{d t}=k[A]^{0}=k\)
Hence, order of reaction must be zero.
27. (b) \(: 2 A \rightarrow B+C\)

The rate equation of this reaction may be expressed as \(r=k[A]^{0}\), Order \(=0, r=k\)
\(\therefore \quad\) The rate is independent of concentration of the reactant \(A\).
28. (b) : \(2 \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5} \rightarrow 4 \mathrm{NO}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2}\)

This is a first order reaction.
\(\therefore \quad\) rate \(=k\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}\right]\);
\[
\left[\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}\right]=\text { rate } / k=\frac{1.02 \times 10^{-4}}{3.4 \times 10^{-5}}=3
\]
29. (c) : For the reaction, \(2 A+B_{2} \rightleftharpoons 2 A B\),

Rate \(\propto[A]^{x}\left[B_{2}\right]^{y}\).
On substituting the given data, we get
From experiment 1,
\[
1.6 \times 10^{-4} \propto[0.50]^{x}[0.50]^{y}
\]

From experiment 2,
\[
3.2 \times 10^{-4} \propto[0.50]^{x}[1.00]^{y}
\]

From experiment 3,
\[
3.2 \times 10^{-4} \propto[1.00]^{x}[1.00]^{y}
\]

On dividing equation (iii) by (ii), we get ,
\(1=\left[\frac{1.00}{0.50}\right]^{x} \Rightarrow 1=2^{x} \Rightarrow 2^{0}=2^{x} \Rightarrow x=0\)
Now, divide equation (ii) by equation (i) we get,
\(2=\left[\frac{1.00}{0.50}\right]^{y} \Rightarrow 2=2^{y} \Rightarrow y=1\)
Thus, rate equation is : Rate \(=k[A]^{0}\left[B_{2}\right]^{1}=k\left[B_{2}\right]\)
30. (a) : For a general reaction,
\(x A+y B+z C \rightarrow\) product, the order of reaction is \(x+y+z\).

Since three molecules undergo change in concentration, therefore it is a third order reaction.
31. (c) : \(A+B \rightarrow C\)

Let rate \(=k[A]^{x}[B]^{y}\)
where order of reaction is \((x+y)\).
Putting the values of exp. 1,2, and 3, we get following equations.
\(0.10=k[0.012]^{x}[0.035]^{y}\)
\(0.80=k[0.024]^{x}[0.070]^{y}\)
\(0.10=k[0.024]^{x}[0.035]^{y}\)

Dividing (ii) by (iii), we get
\(\frac{0.80}{0.10}=\left(\frac{0.070}{0.035}\right)^{y} \Rightarrow 2^{y}=8 \Rightarrow y=3\)
Keeping \([A]\) constant, \([B]\) is doubled, rate becomes 8 times.
Dividing eq. (iii) by eq. (i), we get
\(\frac{0.10}{0.10}=\left(\frac{0.024}{0.012}\right)^{x} \Rightarrow 2^{x}=1 \Rightarrow x=0\)
Keeping \([B]\) constant, \([A]\) is doubled, rate remains unaffected. Hence, rate is independent of \([A]\).
rate \(\propto[B]^{3}\).
32. (b) : For a first order reaction
\(k=\frac{2.303}{t} \log \frac{a}{a-x}\)

t= & \frac{2.303}{4.606 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}} \log \left(\frac{2}{0.2}\right)=\frac{2.303 \times 10^{3}}{4.606}=500 \mathrm{~s}

\]
35. (d) : For \(1^{\text {st }}\) order reaction,
\[

36. (d) : For a first order reaction, \(k=\frac{2.303}{t} \log \frac{[A]_{0}}{[A]_{t}}\)
\(2.303 \times 10^{-3}=\frac{2.303}{t} \log \frac{40}{10}\)
\(t=\frac{1}{10^{-3}} \log 2^{2}=\frac{2}{10^{-3}} \log 2=\frac{2}{10^{-3}} \times 0.3010=602 \mathrm{~s}\)
37. (b) : For the first order reaction, \(t_{1 / 2}=\frac{0.693}{k}\) which is
independent of initial concentration \(A]\) independent of initial concentration \([A]_{0}\).
For second order reaction, \(t_{1 / 2}=\frac{1}{k[A]_{0}}\)
Half-life depends on initial concentration of reactant.
38. (b) : \(\left(t_{1 / 2}\right)_{\text {zero }}=\frac{[A]_{0}}{2 k}\)

As the half-life of a zero order reaction is directly proportional to initial concentration.
\(\therefore \quad\) If \([A]_{0}=\) doubled then, \(t_{1 / 2}=\) doubled.
39. (a) : For a first order reaction,
\(k=\frac{2.303}{t} \log \frac{[A]_{0}}{[A]_{t}}\) or \(10^{-2}=\frac{2.303}{t} \log \frac{20}{5}\)

40. (c) : For a first order reaction, \(A \rightarrow\) Products and for concentration of the reactant at two different times,
\[
\begin{aligned}
& k=\frac{2.303}{t_{2}-t_{1}} \log \frac{[A]_{1}}{[A]_{2}} \\

t_{1 / 2}= & \frac{0.693}{k}=\frac{0.693}{0.0287 \mathrm{sec}^{-1}}=24.14 \mathrm{sec}
\end{aligned}
\]
41. (d) : Half-life period of a first order reaction is independent of initial concentration,
\(t_{1 / 2}=\frac{0.693}{k}\)
42. (a) : As \(t_{75 \%}=2 \times t_{50 \%}\), the order of the reaction is one.
43. (c) : Fall of concentration from \(1.28 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{L}^{-1}\) to \(0.04 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{L}^{-1}\) requires 5 half-lives.
\(\therefore \quad\) Time required \(=5 \times t_{1 / 2}=5 \times 138=690 \mathrm{~s}\)
44. (b) : Given, \(t_{1 / 2}=1386 \mathrm{~s}\)

For a first order reaction,
\[
\begin{aligned}
t_{1 / 2} & =\frac{0.693}{k} \quad(k=\text { rate constant }) \\

\(k=\frac{2.303}{60} \log \frac{100}{40}=\frac{2.303}{60} \times \log 2.5=0.0153\)

\Rightarrow \quad k=\frac{2 \times 10^{-5}}{0.01}=2 \times 10^{-3}, k=\frac{0.693}{t_{1 / 2}} \\
t_{1 / 2}=\frac{0.693}{2 \times 10^{-3}}=346.5 \approx 347 \mathrm{~s}
\end{gathered}
\]
48. (b) : Rate \(\left(\frac{d x}{d t}\right)=k C\)
i.e., \(1.5 \times 10^{-2}=k \times 0.5\) or, \(k=\frac{1.5 \times 10^{-2}}{0.5}\)
For first order reaction,
\(t_{1 / 2}=\frac{0.693}{k}=\frac{0.693 \times 0.5}{1.5 \times 10^{-2}}=23.1 \mathrm{~min}\).
49. (a) : In case I In case II

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\(A\) & \(B\) & \(A\) & \(B\) \\
0.8 & 0 & 0.9 & 0 \\
0.2 & 0.6 & 0.225 & 0.675 \\
1 & 3 & 1 & 3
\end{tabular}

The time taken for the completion of same fraction of change is independent of initial concentration.
50. (c) : For the first order reaction, rate constant is given by,
\(k_{1}=\frac{1}{t} \ln \frac{a}{a-x}\)
\(a=\) initial concentration, \((a-x)=\) concentration at \(t\) time
At \(t=t_{1 / 2}, x=a / 2\)
\(\Rightarrow \quad k_{1}=\frac{1}{t_{1 / 2}} \ln \frac{a}{a-a / 2} \Rightarrow k_{1}=\frac{1}{t_{1 / 2}} \ln 2 \Rightarrow k_{1}=\frac{0.693}{t_{1 / 2}}\)
Therefore, \(t_{1 / 2}\) is independent of initial concentration.
51. (d) : The activation energy of a reaction can be determined by evaluating the rate constant at two different temperatures by using the following expression :
\[
\log \frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}=\frac{E_{a}}{2.303 R}\left[\frac{T_{2}-T_{1}}{T_{1} T_{2}}\right]
\]
52. (d) : According to Arrhenius equation, \(\ln k=-\frac{E_{a}}{R T}+\ln A\) The plot of \(\ln k\) vs \(1 / T\) will be

53. (a) : \(T_{1}=27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=300 \mathrm{~K}, T_{2}=57^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=330 \mathrm{~K}\)

It is given that, \(k_{2}=4 k_{1}\),
We know, \(\log \frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}=\frac{E_{a}}{2.303 R}\left[\frac{T_{2}-T_{1}}{T_{1} T_{2}}\right]\)
Therefore, \(\log \frac{4 k_{1}}{k_{1}}=\frac{E_{a}}{2.303 \times 8.314}\left[\frac{330-300}{300 \times 330}\right]\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad 0.6021=\frac{E_{a} \times 30}{2.303 \times 8.314 \times 300 \times 330} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad E_{a}=38044.03 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}=38.04 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
\]
54. (b) : If \(E_{a}=0\), then according to Arrhenius equation, \(k=A e^{-E_{a} / R T} \Rightarrow k=A e^{0 / R T}=A\).
This implies that every collision results into a chemical reaction which cannot be true. So, a reaction cannot have zero activation energy.
55. (c) : As enthalpy of reaction is negative, hence it is an exothermic reaction.
56. (b) \(: \ln k=-\frac{E_{a}}{R T}+\ln A\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
-\frac{E_{a}}{R}=-5 \times 10^{3} & =-5000 \\
\Rightarrow \quad E_{a}=5000 \times 8.314 & =41570 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\
& =41.57 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
\]
57. (b) : According to Arrhenius equation,
\(\log \frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}=\frac{E_{a}}{2.303 R}\left[\frac{T_{2}-T_{1}}{T_{2} T_{1}}\right]\)
\(\log \frac{k_{2}}{1.6 \times 10^{6}}=0 ; \frac{k_{2}}{1.6 \times 10^{6}}=1\)
\(k_{2}=1.6 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\)
58. (b) : A catalyst provides an alternate path to the reaction which has lower activation energy.
59. (a) : According to Arrhenius equation,
\[
\begin{aligned}
& k=A e^{-E_{a} / R T} \\
& \ln k=\ln A-\frac{E_{a}}{R T}
\end{aligned}
\]

Hence, if \(\ln k\) is plotted
against \(1 / T\), slope of the line will be \(-\frac{E_{a}}{R}\).

60. (a) \(: \log \frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}=\frac{E_{a}}{2.303 R}\left(\frac{1}{T_{1}}-\frac{1}{T_{2}}\right)\)
\(k_{2}=2 k_{1}, T_{1}=20+273=293 \mathrm{~K}\) or \(T_{2}=35+273=308 \mathrm{~K}\)
\(R=8.314 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}\)
\(\log 2=\frac{E_{a}}{2.303 \times 8.314}\left(\frac{1}{293}-\frac{1}{308}\right)\)
\(0.3010=\frac{E_{a}}{19.147} \times \frac{15}{293 \times 308}\)
\(E_{a}=34673 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}=34.7 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
61. (b) : At \(10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) rise, rate increases by 2 .
\[
\frac{r_{100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}}{r_{10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}}=2^{\left(\frac{100-10}{10}\right)}=2^{9}=512 \text { times }
\]
62. (b, d) : \(k_{1}=A e^{-E_{a} / R T_{1}}, k_{2}=A e^{-E_{a} / R T_{2}}\)
\(\ln k_{1}=\ln A-E_{a} / R T_{1}\)
\(\ln k_{2}=\ln A-E_{a} / R T_{2}\)

From eq.(i) and (ii), we have
\(\ln k_{2}-\ln k_{1}=\ln A-\frac{E_{a}}{R T_{2}}-\ln A+\frac{E_{a}}{R T_{1}}\)
\(\Rightarrow \ln \frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}=\frac{E_{a}}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_{1}}-\frac{1}{T_{2}}\right) \Rightarrow \ln \frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}=-\frac{E_{a}}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_{2}}-\frac{1}{T_{1}}\right)\)
63. (a) : Rate constant is independent of the initial concentration of the reactants. It has a constant value at fixed temperature. According to Arrhenius equation, the value of rate constant can be increased by increasing the temperature.
64. (b) : \(k_{1}=10^{16} e^{-2000 / T}, k_{2}=10^{15} e^{-1000 / T}\)

When, \(k_{1}=k_{2}, 10^{16} e^{-2000 / T}=10^{15} e^{-1000 / T}\)
or \(\quad 10 e^{-2000 / T}=e^{-1000 / T}\)
Taking natural logarithm of both sides, we get
\(\ln 10-\frac{2000}{T}=\frac{-1000}{T}\) or \(2.303-\frac{2000}{T}=\frac{-1000}{T}\)
or \(\frac{1000}{T}=2.303\) or \(T=\frac{1000}{2.303} \mathrm{~K}\)
65. (c) : On plotting \(\log k\) vs \(1 / T\), we get a straight line, the slope indicates the value of activation energy.
66. (c) : Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required to convert reactant into product. Activation energy for reverse reaction can be less than or more than \(E_{a}\) depending whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic.
67. (c) : According to \(k=A e^{-E a / R T}\) (Arrhenius equation), the activation energy of a reaction in the presence of enzyme is different from \(E_{a}\) obtained in laboratory.
68. (a) : Enzymes act like catalyst in biochemical reactions. Presence of an enzyme increases the rate of reaction by lowering the activation energy of the reactant.
69. (a) : According to Arrhenius equation :
\[
\log \frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}=\frac{E_{a}}{2.303 R}\left[\frac{T_{2}-T_{1}}{T_{2} T_{1}}\right]
\]
where \(E_{a}=\) activation energy
\(R=\) gas constant \(=8.314 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)
\(k_{1}\) and \(k_{2}\) are rate constants of the reaction at two different temperatures \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) respectively.
70. (b) : Since the enzymes are regarded as biological catalysts, therefore their action increases the rate of biological reaction.
71. (d) : Collision frequency \(\propto\) no. of reacting molecules or atoms
Higher the concentration of reactant molecules, higher is the probability of collision and so the collision frequency.

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (d) : Maximum covalency of boron is four due to the absence of \(d\)-orbitals. Hence, its trihalide cannot be hydrolysed to produce an ion of the form \(\left[M\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{6}\right]^{3+}\).
2. (b) : As we move down the group, the stability of the +3 oxidation state decreases while that of +1 oxidation state increases. Thus, stability order for +1 oxidation state is \(\mathrm{Al}<\mathrm{Ga} <\mathrm{In}<\mathrm{Tl}\) and +3 oxidation state is \(\mathrm{Al}>\mathrm{Ga}>\mathrm{In}>\mathrm{Tl}\).
Hence, the stability order is, \(\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}>\mathrm{AlCl}, \mathrm{TlI}>\mathrm{TlI}_{3}\), \(\mathrm{TlCl}>\mathrm{TlCl}_{3}\) and \(\mathrm{InI}>\mathrm{InI}_{3}\).
3. (d) : \(\mathrm{BF}_{3}\) is a \(s p^{2}\)-hybridised planar molecule. It forms \(3 \sigma\)-bonds with 3F-atoms, hence has six electrons around it.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-142.jpg?height=177&width=160&top_left_y=2078&top_left_x=1318)
4. (d)
5. (b) : \(\mathrm{AlF}_{3}\) is insoluble in anhydrous HF because the \(\mathrm{F}^{-}\) ions are not available in hydrogen bonded HF molecules but, it becomes soluble in presence of little amount of KF due to formation of complex, \(\mathrm{K}_{3}\left[\mathrm{AlF}_{6}\right]\).
\(\mathrm{AlF}_{3}+3 \mathrm{KF} \rightarrow \mathrm{K}_{3}\left[\mathrm{AlF}_{6}\right]\)
6. (a) : In group 13 elements, stability of +3 oxidation state decreases down the group while that of +1 oxidation state increases due to inert pair effect. Hence, stability of +1 oxidation state increases in the sequence :
\(\mathrm{Al}<\mathrm{Ga}<\mathrm{In}<\mathrm{Tl}\).
7. (b) : \(\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}\) forms a dimer, as Al due to the presence of \(3 d\)-orbitals can expand its covalency from four to six. Also dimerisation enables Al atoms to complete their octets.
<smiles>Cl[Al]1(Cl)[Al](Cl)(Cl)[Al](Cl)(Cl)[Al]1Cl</smiles>
8. (c) : Boron does not have vacant \(d\)-orbitals in its valence shell, so it cannot expand its covalency beyond 4 i.e., 'B' cannot form the ions like \(M F_{6}^{3-}\).
9. (b) : The relative Lewis acid character of boron trihalides is found to follow the following order, \(\mathrm{BBr}_{3}>\mathrm{BCl}_{3}>\mathrm{BF}_{3}\), but the expected order on the basis of electronegativity of the halogens (electronegativity of halogens decreases from F to I ) should be, \(\mathrm{BF}_{3}>\mathrm{BCl}_{3}>\mathrm{BBr}_{3}\).
This anomaly is explained on the basis of the relative tendency of the halogen atom to back donate its unutilised electrons to vacant \(p\)-orbital of boron atom. In \(\mathrm{BF}_{3}\), boron has a vacant \(2 p\)-orbital and each fluorine has fully filled unutilised \(2 p\)-orbitals. Fluorine transfers two electrons to vacant \(2 p\)-orbital of boron, thus forming \(p \pi-p \pi\) bond.

This type of bond has some double bond character and is known as dative or back bonding. All the three bond lengths are same. It is possible when double bond is delocalized. The delocalization may be represented as :
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-143.jpg?height=184&width=563&top_left_y=1601&top_left_x=376)

The tendency to back donate decreases from F to I as energy level difference between B and halogen atom increases from F to I . So, the order of Lewis acid strength is \(\mathrm{BF}_{3}<\mathrm{BCl}_{3}<\mathrm{BBr}_{3}\).
10. (b) : Lewis acids are those substances which can accept a pair of electrons and boron compounds usually are deficient in electrons.
11. (d) : In diborane \(\left(\mathrm{B}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}\right)\), each boron (B) atom uses \(s p^{3}\) hybrid orbitals for bonding.
12. (c) : Boric acid behaves as a Lewis acid, by accepting a pair of electrons from \(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)ion of water thereby releasing a proton.
13. (c) : BN is known as inorganic graphite and has structure similar to graphite.
14. (a) : Each ' B ' atom in diborane \(\left(\mathrm{B}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}\right)\) is \(s p^{3}\)-hybridised. Of the 4 -hybrid orbitals, three have one electron each, while the \(4^{\text {th }}\) is empty. Two orbitals of each form \(\sigma\) bonds with two ' H 'atoms, while one of the remaining hybrid orbital (either filled
or empty), \(1 s\) orbital of ' H ' atom and one of the hybrid orbitals of other ' B ' atom overlap to form three centered two electron bond. So there exists two such type of three centered bonds.
15. (c) : \(\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{BO}_{3}\) is a weak monobasic acid.
\(\mathrm{B}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow\left[\mathrm{B}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}\right]^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}\)
16. (b) : Generally, the halides of group-14 elements are covalent in nature. \(\mathrm{PbF}_{4}\) and \(\mathrm{SnF}_{4}\) are exceptions which are ionic in nature.
17. (a) : \(\left[\mathrm{SiCl}_{6}\right]^{2-}\) is not stable due to steric hindrance by large sized Cl atoms.
18. (d): The inertness of \(s\)-subshell electrons towards bond formation is known as inert pair effect. This effect increases down the group thus, for \(\mathrm{Sn},+4\) oxidation state is more stable, whereas, for \(\mathrm{Pb},+2\) oxidation state is more stable, i.e., \(\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}\) is reducing while \(\mathrm{Pb}^{4+}\) is oxidising.
19. (a) : When \(n s^{2}\) electrons of outermost shell do not participate in bonding then these \(n s^{2}\) electrons are called inert pair and the effect is called inert pair effect. Due to this inert pair effect \(\mathrm{Ge}, \mathrm{Sn}\) and Pb of group 14 have a tendency to form both +4 and +2 ions. Now the inert pair effect increases down the group, hence the stability of \(M^{2+}\) ions increases and \(M^{4+}\) ions decreases down the group. For this reason, \(\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\) is more stable than \(\mathrm{Pb}^{4+}\) and \(\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}\) is more stable than \(\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}\).
20. (a) : Carbon has no \(d\)-orbitals, while silicon contains \(d\)-orbitals in its valence shell which can be used for bonding purposes.
21. (a) : A-III, B-I, C-IV, D-II
22. (c) : In diamond, each carbon atom undergoes \(s p^{3}\) hybridisation and linked to four other carbon atoms by using hybridised orbitals in tetrahedral fashion. In graphite, each carbon atom in hexagonal ring undergoes \(s p^{2}\) hybridisation and make three sigma bonds with three neighbouring carbon atoms. Fourth electron forms a \(\pi\)-bond.
23. (a) : Except diamond other three conduct electricity. Potassium and sodium are metallic conductors, while graphite is a non-metallic conductor.
24. (c) : Lead pencil contains graphite and clay. It does not contain lead.
25. (c) : In graphite, each carbon atom undergoes \(s p^{2}\)-hybridisation and is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms by single bonds. The fourth electron forms \(\pi\)-bond. The electrons are delocalised over the whole sheet, i.e., electrons are spread out between the structure.
26. (b) : In diamond, each carbon atom is \(s p^{3}\) hybridized and thus, forms covalent bonds with four other carbon atoms lying at the corners of a regular tetrahedron.
27. (c) : All the above are conductors except diamond. Diamond is an insulator.
28. (d) : (A) Solid \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) (dry ice) is used as refrigerant for icecream and frozen food.
(B) The structure of \(\mathrm{C}_{60}\) contains twenty six-membered rings and twelve five-membered rings.
(C) and (D) are correct statements.
29. (c) : Silicones being biocompatible are used in surgical and cosmetic plants.
30. (a) : It can form only dimer.
31. (d) : \(\mathrm{SiO}_{4}^{4-}\) orthosilicate is basic unit of silicates.
32. (d) : Feldspars are three dimensional alumino-silicates.
33. (c) : Pyrosilicate contains two units of \(\mathrm{SiO}_{4}^{4-}\) joined along a corner containing oxygen atom.
<smiles>[O-][Si]([O-])([O-])O[Si]([O-])([O-])[O-]</smiles>
34. (c) : Hydrolysis of substituted chlorosilanes yields corresponding silanols which undergo polymerisation. Out of the given chlorosilanes, only \(\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SiCl}_{2}\) will give linear polymer on hydrolysis followed by polymerisation.

35. (b) : Chain silicates are formed by sharing two oxygen atoms by each tetrahedra. Anions of chain silicate have two general formula :
(i) \(\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{3}\right)_{n}^{2 n-}\)
(ii) \(\left(\mathrm{Si}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{11}\right)_{n}^{6 n-}\)
36. (d) : In zeolites, some of the \(\mathrm{Si}^{4+}\) ions may be replaced by \(\mathrm{Al}^{3+}\) ions. This results in unbalanced anionic charge. To maintain electrical neutrality, positive ions must be introduced.
37. (a) : \(\mathrm{SiCl}_{4}\) gets hydrolysed in moist air and gives white fumes which are used as a smoke screen in warfare.
38. (c) : \(\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4} \Rightarrow 2 x+4(+1)=0\)
\(\Rightarrow 2 x+4=0 \Rightarrow x=-2\)
\(\mathrm{NH}_{3} \Rightarrow x+3(+1)=0 \Rightarrow x=-3\)
\(\mathrm{N}_{3} \mathrm{H} \Rightarrow 3 x+1(+1)=0\)
\(\Rightarrow 3 x+1=0 \Rightarrow x=-1 / 3\)
\(\mathrm{NH}_{2} \mathrm{OH} \Rightarrow x+2+1(-2)+1=0\)
\(\Rightarrow x+1=0 \Rightarrow x=-1\)
Thus, highest oxidation state is \(-1 / 3\).
39. (b) : For strong \(\pi\)-bonding, \(p \pi-p \pi\) bonding should be strong. In case of P , due to larger size as compared to N -atom, \(p \pi-p \pi\) bonding is not so strong.
40. (c) : Among N, P, As and Sb, the former has highest electronegativity ( \(E N\) ) so its oxide is most acidic.
As the electronegativity value of element increases, the acidic character of the oxide also increases.
41. (c) : Due to greater electronegativity of nitrogen, dipole moment for \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\) is greater.
42. (a) : All the hydrides of group V elements have one lone pair of electrons on their central atom. Therefore, they can act as Lewis bases. The basic character of these hydrides decreases down the group.
43. (a) : The acidic character of the oxides decreases with the decrease in the oxidation state and also decreases down the group.
44. (a) : Nitrogen cannot form pentahalides because it cannot expand its octet due to non-availability of \(d\)-orbitals.
45. (b) : Boiling point of hydrides increases with increase in atomic number but ammonia has exceptionally high boiling point due to hydrogen bonding. Thus, the correct order of boiling point is,
\[
\mathrm{BiH}_{3}>\mathrm{SbH}_{3}>\mathrm{NH}_{3}>\mathrm{AsH}_{3}>\mathrm{PH}_{3}
\]
46. (a) : Nitrogen molecule is diatomic containing a triple bond between two N atoms, \(\ddot{\mathrm{N}} \equiv \ddot{\mathrm{N}}\) therefore, nitrogen molecule is formed by sharing six electrons.
47. (d) : \(\mathrm{N}_{2}\) molecule contains triple bond between N atoms having very high dissociation energy ( \(941.4 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\) ) due to which it is relatively inactive.

(Dibasic)
66. (d) : All oxyacids of phosphorus which have \(\mathrm{P}-\mathrm{H}\) bonds act as strong reducing agents. \(\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{2}\) has two \(\mathrm{P}-\mathrm{H}\) bonds hence, it acts as a strong reducing agent.

68. (d) : The oxidation state can be calculated as:
\(\mathrm{H}_{4} \mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}:+4+2 x+5(-2)=0 \Rightarrow 2 x-6=0 \Rightarrow x=+3\)
\(\mathrm{H}_{4} \mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{6}:+4+2 x+6(-2)=0 \Rightarrow 2 x-8=0 \Rightarrow x=+4\)
\(\mathrm{H}_{4} \mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}:+4+2 x+7(-2)=0 \Rightarrow 2 x-10=0 \Rightarrow x=+5\)
69. (a) :
<smiles>O=P12OP3(=O)OC4(O1)OP(=O)([O])OP(=O)(O2)O3</smiles>
70. (c) : The formula of hypophosphorous acid is \(\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{2}\) as shown in (c). It is a monobasic acid.
71. (c) : \(\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{2}\) is named as hypophosphorous acid. As it contains only one \(\mathrm{P}-\mathrm{OH}\) group, its basicity is one.
<smiles>O=[PH2]O</smiles>
72. (a) : \(\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}\) absorbs moisture much readily than anhydrous \(\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}\).
73. (d) : \(\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \xrightarrow{\Delta} 2 \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}\)
74. (b) : Orthophosphoric acid, \(\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}\) contains three \(\mathrm{P}-\mathrm{OH}\) groups and is therefore, tribasic.
<smiles>O=P(O)(O)O</smiles>
75. (d) : On heating, it gives pyrophosphoric acid at 525 K and metaphosphoric acid at 875 K .
\[
\underset{\substack{\text { Orthophosphoric } \\ \text { acid }}}{2 \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}} \xrightarrow[\substack{\text { Pyrophosphoric } \\ \text { acid }}]{525 \mathrm{~K}} \mathrm{H}_{4} \mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7} \xrightarrow[\substack{\text { Metaphosphoric } \\ \text { acid }}]{875 \mathrm{~K}} 2 \mathrm{HPO}_{3}
\]
76. (a) : \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) has higher boiling point due to extensive hydrogen bonding.
\[
\begin{array}{ll}

\text { B.pt. } & 373 \mathrm{~K} 269 \mathrm{~K} 232 \mathrm{~K} 213 \mathrm{~K}
\end{array}
\]

Hence, both statements I and II are correct.
77. (d) : Going down the group, electronegative character increases, thus tendency to show -2 oxidation state decreases from sulphur to polonium. Hence, Po does not show -2 oxidation state.
78. (b) :
\(\begin{array}{cccc}\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S} & \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Se} & \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Te} \\ \text { B.Pt. : } & 373 \mathrm{~K} & 213 \mathrm{~K} & 232 \mathrm{~K}\end{array} 269 \mathrm{~K}\)
79. (d) : The thermal stability of hydrides decreases from \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) to \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Po}\). This is because as the size of atom \(E\) in \(\mathrm{H}_{2} E\) increases, the bond \(\mathrm{H}-E\) becomes weaker and thus, breaks on heating. Therefore, the correct order of thermal stability is \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Po}<\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Te}<\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Se}<\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}<\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\).
80. (a) : As the atomic size increases down the group, the bond length increases and the bond strength decreases and the cleavage of \(E-\mathrm{H}\) bond becomes easier thus, more will be the acidity. Thus, the correct order is: \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}<\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Se}<\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Te}\).
81. (a) : Bond energy of S - S is exceptionally high due to its catenation tendency.

The remaining constituents of liquid air i.e., liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen are separated by means of fractional distillation as fractional distillation is a process of separation of mixture based on the difference in their boiling points.

101. (c) : All halogens show both positive and negative oxidation states while fluorine shows only negative oxidation state except +1 in HOF.

\end{tabular}

A reason for this anomaly is the relatively large electronelectron repulsion among the lone pairs in \(\mathrm{F}_{2}\) molecule where they are much closer to each other than in case of \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\).
103. (a) : HF forms strong intermolecular H -bonding due to high electronegativity of F . Hence, the boiling point of HF is abnormally high. Boiling points of other hydrogen halides gradually increase from HCl to HI due to increase in size of halogen atoms from Cl to I which further increase the magnitude of van der Waals' forces.
104. (d) : Standard reduction potentials of halogens are positive and decrease from fluorine to iodine. So, \(\mathrm{F}_{2}\) is the strongest oxidising agent.
105. (a, d) : In case of diatomic molecules \(\left(X_{2}\right)\) of halogens the bond dissociation energy decreases in the order : \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}>\mathrm{Br}_{2}>\mathrm{F}_{2}>\mathrm{I}_{2}\). This is due to relatively large electronelectron repulsion among the lone pairs is \(\mathrm{F}_{2}\) than in case of \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\).
The oxidising power, electronegativity and reactivity decrease in the order : \(\mathrm{F}_{2}>\mathrm{Cl}_{2}>\mathrm{Br}_{2}>\mathrm{I}_{2}\)
Electron gain enthalpy of halogens follows the given order :
\[
\mathrm{Cl}_{2}>\mathrm{F}_{2}>\mathrm{Br}_{2}>\mathrm{I}_{2}
\]

The low value of electron gain enthalpy of fluorine is probably due to small size of fluorine atom.

Bond dissociation \(\quad\)\begin{tabular}{lllll}
38 & 57 & 45.5 & 35.6
\end{tabular}
energy (kcal/mol)

The lower value of bond dissociation energy of fluorine is due to the high inter-electronic repulsions between non-bonding electrons in the \(2 p\)-orbitals of fluorine. As a result F-F bond is weaker in comparison to \(\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{Cl}\) and \(\mathrm{Br}-\mathrm{Br}\) bonds.
107. (a) : Due to more repulsion in between non-bonding electron pairs ( \(2 p\) ) of two fluorines (due to small size of F-atom) in comparison to non-bonding electron pairs ( \(3 p\) ) in chlorine, the bond energy of \(\mathrm{F}_{2}\) is less than \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\).
B.E. \(\left(\mathrm{F}_{2}\right)=158.8 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}\) and
B.E. \(\left(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right)=242.6 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}\)
108. (d) : In general, the electron affinity decreases from top to bottom in a group. But in group 17, fluorine has lower electron affinity as compared to chlorine due to very small size of fluorine atom. As a result, there are strong interelectronic repulsions in the relatively small \(2 s\) orbitals of fluorine and thus, the incoming electron does not experience much attraction.
109. (c) : Since chlorine is stronger oxidising agent than bromine, therefore it will displace bromine from an aqueous solution containing bromide ions.

\mathrm{Cl}_{2}+2 \mathrm{Br}^{-} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{Br}_{2}

\[
2 \mathrm{Br}^{-}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{Br}_{2}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}
\]
117. (d) : Bleaching action of chlorine is due to oxidation in presence of moisture. Bleaching effect is permanent.
\[
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HCl}+[\mathrm{O}]
\]

119. (d): The acidic character of the oxoacids increases with increase in oxidation number of the halogen atom i.e., \(\mathrm{HClO}<\mathrm{HClO}_{2}<\mathrm{HClO}_{3}<\mathrm{HClO}_{4}\).
This can be explained on the basis of relative stability of the anions left after removal of a proton. Since the stability of the anion decreases in the order : \(\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}>\mathrm{ClO}_{3}^{-}>\mathrm{ClO}_{2}^{-}>\mathrm{ClO}^{-}\), acid strength also decreases in the same order.
120. (c) : \(\mathrm{OF}_{2}\) (oxygen difluoride) is a fluoride of oxygen because fluorine is more electronegative than oxygen.

123. (a) : In general, interhalogen compounds are more reactive than halogens (except fluorine). This is because \(X-X^{\prime}\) (ICl) bond in interhalogens is weaker than \(\mathrm{X}-\mathrm{X}\) (I-I) bond in halogens except F-F bond.
124. (a)
125. (a) : Helium is used as a diluent for oxygen in modern diving apparatus because of its very low solubility in blood.
126. (c) : Noble gases have very low melting and boiling points because the only type of interatomic interaction in these elements is weak dispersion forces.

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (b) : \(\mathrm{Sc}(Z=21)\) has incompletely filled \(3 d\)-orbitals in its ground state ( \(3 d^{1}\) ), it is considered as a transition element but \(\mathrm{Zn}(Z=30)\) has completely filled \(d\)-orbitals \(\left(3 d^{10}\right)\) in its ground state and its common oxidation state ( +2 ), thus, it is not considered as a transition element.
2. (d) : The electronic configuration of the given ions is
\(\mathrm{Ni}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{7} 4 s^{0}, \mathrm{Mn}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{4} 4 s^{0}\)
\(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{5} 4 s^{0}, \mathrm{Co}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{6} 4 s^{0}\)
Thus, \(\mathrm{Co}^{3+}\) is the ion with the desired configuration.
3. (d) : \(22 \mathrm{Ti}: 3 d^{2} 4 s^{2} ; \mathrm{Ti}^{2+}: 3 d^{2}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& { }_{23} \mathrm{~V}: 3 d^{3} 4 s^{2} ; \mathrm{V}^{3+}: 3 d^{2} \\
& { }_{24} \mathrm{Cr}: 3 d^{4} 4 s^{2} ; \mathrm{Cr}^{4+}: 3 d^{2} \\
& { }_{25} \mathrm{Mn}: 3 d^{5} 4 s^{2} ; \mathrm{Mn}^{5+}: 3 d^{2}
\end{aligned}
\]
4. (d)
5. (b)
6. (c)
7. (a) :

\begin{tabular}{lcc} 
& Species & No. of unpaired electrons \\
A. & \(\mathrm{Ti}^{3+}\) & 1 \\
B. & \(\mathrm{Cr}^{2+}\) & 4 \\
C. & \(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}\) & 5 \\
D. & \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\) & 4 \\
E. & \(\mathrm{Sc}^{3+}\) & 0
\end{tabular}

Thus B and D have same spin only magnetic moment \(=\sqrt{4(4+2)}=4.90\) B.M.
8. (c) : \({ }_{25} \mathrm{Mn} \Rightarrow[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{5} 4 s^{2}\)
\(\mathrm{Mn}^{3+} \Rightarrow[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{4}\)
\(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+} \Rightarrow[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{5}\)
As \(d^{5}\) is a half filled electronic configuration, it is highly stable configuration. Thus, \(\mathrm{Mn}^{3+}\) has high tendency to get reduced to \(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}\)
9. (c) : For a given value of \(l, m_{l}\) has ( \(2 l+1\) ) values. For \(l=2\), the number of \(m_{l}\) values is \([2(2)+1]=5\). But in set (b), only four values of \(m_{l}\) are given. The values of \(m_{l}\) range from \(-l\) to \(+l\) including 0 .
Hence, the possible \(m_{l}\) values for the given orbital are \(-2,-1\), \(0,+1,+2\).
10. (a) : The stability of \(\mathrm{Cu}_{(a q)}^{2+}\) rather than \(\mathrm{Cu}_{(a q)}^{+}\)is due to the much more negative \(\Delta_{\text {hyd }} H^{\circ}\) of \(\mathrm{Cu}_{(\text {aq })}^{2+}\) than \(\mathrm{Cu}_{(\text {aq })}^{+}\), which more than compensates for the second ionisation enthalpy of Cu .
\(\mathrm{V}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\) dissolves in acids to give \(\mathrm{VO}^{2+}\) salts.
11. (d) : The atomic and ionic radii of Zr and Hf are almost identical due to poor shielding effect of 4 f-electrons, which lead to the lanthanoid contraction.
12. (d): The oxidation states of Cr in \(\mathrm{CrO}_{4}^{2-}\) and \(\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}^{2-}\) is same i.e., +6.
13. (b) : \(\mathrm{Cr}: 3 d^{5} 4 s^{1}, \mathrm{Cr}^{2+}: 3 d^{4}\) has four unpaired electrons.
\[
\mu=\sqrt{n(n+2)}=\sqrt{4(4+2)}=\sqrt{24} \approx 4.90 \text { B.M. }
\]
14. (a) : \(\mathrm{Co}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{6}\), unpaired \(e^{-}(n)=4\)

Spin magnetic moment \((\mu)=\sqrt{4(4+2)}=\sqrt{24}\) B.M.
\(\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{3}\), unpaired \(e^{-}(n)=3\)
Spin magnetic moment \((\mu)=\sqrt{3(3+2)}=\sqrt{15}\) B.M.
\(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{5}\), unpaired \(e^{-}(n)=5\)
Spin magnetic moment \((\mu)=\sqrt{5(5+2)}=\sqrt{35}\) B.M.
\(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{8}\), unpaired \(e^{-}(n)=2\)
Spin magnetic moment \((\mu)=\sqrt{2(2+2)}=\sqrt{8}\) B.M.
15. (c): Magnetic moment \((\mu)=\sqrt{n(n+2)}\)
2.84 B.M. corresponds to 2 unpaired electrons.
\(\mathrm{Cr}^{2+}: 3 d^{4}, 4\) unpaired electrons
\(\mathrm{Co}^{2+}: 3 d^{7}, 3\) unpaired electrons
\(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}: 3 d^{8}, 2\) unpaired electrons
\(\mathrm{Ti}^{3+}: 3 d^{1}, 1\) unpaired electron
16. (d) : Interstitial compounds are generally chemically inert.
17. (b) : Invar ⇒ Ni(metal) +Fe (metal)

Steel ⇒ C(non-metal) \(+\mathrm{Fe}(\) metal \()\)
Bell ⇒ Cu(metal) \(+\mathrm{Sn}(\) metal \()+\mathrm{Fe}(\) metal \()\)
Bronze ⇒ Cu(metal) +Sn (metal)
18. (c)
19. (c) : Element: \(\mathrm{Ti}<\mathrm{V}<\mathrm{Cr}<\mathrm{Mn}\)

No. of oxidation states : 3456
Hence, given order is correct.
Magnetic moment \((\mu)=\sqrt{n(n+2)}\) B.M.
For \(\mathrm{Ti}^{3+} n=1, \mu=\sqrt{1(1+2)}=\sqrt{3}\) B.M.
For \(\mathrm{V}^{3+} n=2, \mu=\sqrt{2(2+2)}=\sqrt{8}\) B.M.
For \(\mathrm{Cr}^{3+} n=3, \mu=\sqrt{3(3+2)}=\sqrt{15}\) B.M.
For \(\mathrm{Mn}^{3+} n=4, \mu=\sqrt{4(4+2)}=\sqrt{24}\) B.M.
Thus, magnetic moment order : \(\mathrm{Ti}^{3+}<\mathrm{V}^{3+}<\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}<\mathrm{Mn}^{3+}\)
Melting point order : Mn < Ti < Cr < V \(1245^{\circ} \mathrm{C} 1668^{\circ} \mathrm{C} 1875^{\circ} \mathrm{C} 1900^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)
\(2^{\text {nd }}\) ionisation enthalpy order \(\mathrm{Ti}<\mathrm{V}<\mathrm{Mn}<\mathrm{Cr}\) (in kJ/mol) : 1309141415091592
20. (c) : Element: Co Ni Cu Fe
\(E^{\circ}{ }_{M^{2+} / M}(\mathrm{~V}):-0.28-0.25+0.34-0.44\)
21. (a) : Spin correlation and exchange energy gives an electronic configuration a special stability which is greatest for half-filled electronic configurations.
\(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}\left(d^{5}\right)\) gets stabilisation due to half-filled configuration.
In \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\left(d^{6}\right)\) the placing of one extra electron in a subshell destabilises. Placing of 2 electrons in \(\mathrm{Co}^{2+}\left(d^{7}\right)\) destabilises it more. \(\mathrm{Cr}^{2+}\left(d^{4}\right)\) has one vacant subshell. \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\) gets more stabilisation compared to \(\mathrm{Cr}^{2+}\) through exchange energy. So, the order is as follows : \(\mathrm{Mn}>\mathrm{Fe}>\mathrm{Cr}>\mathrm{Co}\).
22. (b) : Ions which have unpaired electrons exhibit colour in aqueous solution. \(\mathrm{Ti}^{3+}\) has an outer electronic configuration of \(4 s^{0} 3 d^{1}\), i.e., 1 unpaired electron. Thus, its solution will be coloured. Others are colourless due to empty or completely filled outermost orbitals.
23. (c) : \(\mathrm{Hf}^{4+}\) and \(\mathrm{Zr}^{4+}\) belong to group IVB. But, \(\mathrm{Hf}^{4+}\) has same size as \(\mathrm{Zr}^{4+}\) due to the addition of 14 lanthanide elements before it in which electrons are added into the \(f\)-subshell which poorly shield the outer electrons and contraction in size occurs.
24. (b) : Greater the number of valence electrons, more will be the number of oxidation states exhibited by the element.
\(3 d^{5} 4 s^{1}\), can show a maximum of 6 oxidation states.
\(3 d^{5} 4 s^{2}\), can show a maximum of 7 oxidation states.
\(3 d^{2} 4 s^{2}\) can show a maximum of 4 oxidation states.
\(3 d^{3} 4 s^{2}\) can show a maximum of 5 oxidation states.
25. (c) : Electronic configuration of the given elements are
\(\mathrm{Mn}: 1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 3 d^{5} 4 s^{2}\)
\(\mathrm{Cr}: 1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 3 d^{5} 4 s^{1}\)
\(\mathrm{Ti}: 1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 3 d^{2} 4 s^{2}\)
\(\mathrm{V}: 1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 3 d^{3} 4 s^{2}\)
In general, ionization potential (both 1st and 2nd) increases from left to right across the period due to increase in effective nuclear charge. On this basis, the second \(I P\) values should exhibit the trend :
\[
\mathrm{Mn}>\mathrm{Cr}>\mathrm{V}>\mathrm{Ti}
\]

But the actual observed order is: \(\mathrm{Cr}>\mathrm{Mn}>\mathrm{V}>\mathrm{Ti}\)
Practically, only chromium is exceptional and rest others show the normal trend. This exceptional behaviour of chromium is due to the stable configuration \(\left(3 d^{5}\right)\) that it achieves after the loss of first electron.
26. (b) : Sc : \([\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{1} 4 s^{2}, \mathrm{Sc}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] \quad\) Colourless
\(\mathrm{Ti}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{2} 4 s^{2}, \mathrm{Ti}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{1}\) Coloured
\(\mathrm{Ni}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{8} 4 s^{2}, \mathrm{Ni}^{2+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{8}\) Coloured
\(\mathrm{Cu}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{10} 4 s^{1}, \mathrm{Cu}^{+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{10}\) Colourless
\(\mathrm{Co}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{7} 4 s^{2}, \mathrm{Co}^{2+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{7}\) Coloured
\(\mathrm{Ti}^{3+}, \mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) and \(\mathrm{Co}^{2+}\) are coloured due to presence of unpaired electrons.
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \text { 27. (c): } \\
& \quad \mathrm{V}^{2+}(23):[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{3} 4 s^{0} \\

& 3260 \quad 2990 \quad 2962 \quad 2833
\end{aligned}
\]
28. (a) : If the transition metal ion has unpaired electron then it shows colour.
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Sc}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{0} 4 s^{0} \\
& \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{5} 4 s^{1} \\
& \mathrm{Ti}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{1} 4 s^{0} \\
& \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{5} 4 s^{0}
\end{aligned}
\]
\(\mathrm{Sc}^{3+}\) does not contain unpaired electron, hence it will not undergo \(d-d\) transition and do not show colour.
29. (d) : The transition elements, on account of their variable valency, are able to form unstable intermediate compounds very readily.
30. (d) : The order of basicity of transition metal monoxides is, \(\mathrm{TiO}>\mathrm{VO}>\mathrm{CrO}>\mathrm{FeO}\).
31. (c) : Each of the element in group III B to VII B can show the maximum oxidation state equal to its group number. Mn is in group seven shows a maximum oxidation state of +7 in \(\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}\).
32. (b) : \({ }_{21} \mathrm{Sc}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{1} 4 s^{2}\)

In \(\mathrm{Sc}^{3+}\) there is no unpaired ' \(d\) ' electrons, therefore it is colourless in its solution.
33. (b) : Bell metal \(\Rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}=80 \%, \mathrm{Sn}=20 \%\)

It is used for making bells, utensils, etc.
34. (d) : In iron carbonyl, the oxidation number of ' Fe ' is zero.
\[
\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CO})_{5}\right]: x+5 \times 0=0 \Rightarrow x=0
\]
35. (d) : \(\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}(24): 1 s^{2}, 2 s^{2}, 2 p^{6}, 3 s^{2}, 3 p^{6}, 3 d^{3}\)

As \(\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}\) ion has three unpaired electrons in its valence shell, so it imparts colour to an aqueous solution.
36. (c) : The metal atom will have three more electrons.

Therefore, the atomic number of the metal \(=18+4+3\)
\[
=25
\]
37. (b) : In \(\mathrm{TiF}_{6}^{2-}\), titanium is in +4 oxidation state. In \(\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\), the copper is in +1 state. Thus, in both cases, transition from one \(d\)-orbital to other is not possible.
\(\mathrm{Ti}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{2} 4 s^{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ti}^{4+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{0} 4 s^{0}\)
\(\mathrm{Cu}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{10} 4 s^{1} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{10} 4 s^{0}\)
38. (d) : Very high ionisation energy of Hg makes it difficult for electrons to participate in metallic bonding.
39. (a) : In vanadium, there is gradual change of basic character from the basic \(\mathrm{V}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\) to less basic \(\mathrm{V}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\) and to amphoteric \(\mathrm{V}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}\).

In \(\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}, \mathrm{Mn}^{7+}(n=0)\) diamagnetic
In \(\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{2-}, \mathrm{Mn}^{6+}(n=1)\) paramagnetic
In \(\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{2-}\), one unpaired electron ( \(n\) ) is present in \(d\)-orbital so, \(d\) - \(d\) transition is possible.

50. (b) : In alkaline medium :

54. (a) : Among the given lanthanoid ions, \(\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\) and \(\mathrm{Yb}^{2+}\) are diamagnetic in nature.
Electronic configuration of \(\mathrm{Ce}:[\mathrm{Xe}] 4 f^{1} 5 d^{1} 6 s^{2}\) and \(\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}:[\mathrm{Xe}]\)
Electronic configuration of \(\mathrm{Yb}:[\mathrm{Xe}] 4 f^{14} 6 s^{2}\) and \(\mathrm{Yb}^{2+}:[\mathrm{Xe}] 4 f^{14}\)
55. (b) : Due to high exchange enthalpy, \(\mathrm{Gd}^{3+}\left(4 f^{7}\right)\) acquires extra stability and has low third ionisation enthalpy.
56. (c) : The first few members of the lanthanoid series are quite reactive, almost like calcium. However, with increasing atomic number, their behaviour becomes similar to that of aluminium.
57. (b)
58. (b)
59. (a) : Zr and Hf have nearly same radii due to lanthanoid contraction.
60. (a) : Due to poor shielding effect of \(4 f\)-orbitals, nucleus will exert a strong attraction and size of atom or ion goes on decreasing as move in the series with increase in atomic number.
61. (b) : \(\mathrm{Sm}^{2+}(Z=62):[\mathrm{Xe}] 4 f^{6}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Eu}^{2+}(Z=63):[\mathrm{Xe}] 4 f^{7} \\
& \mathrm{Yb}^{2+}(Z=70):[\mathrm{Xe}] 4 f^{14} \\

\end{aligned}
\]

Only \(\mathrm{Yb}^{2+}\) is diamagnetic.
62. (d) : The common stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids is +3 . The oxidation state of +2 and +4 are also exhibited by some of the elements. These oxidation states are only stable in those cases where stable \(4 f^{0}, 4 f^{7}\) or \(4 f^{14}\) configurations are achieved.
63. (b) : In each vertical column of transition elements, the elements of second and third transition series resemble each other more closely than the elements of first and second transition series on account of lanthanide contraction. Hence, the properties of elements of \(4 d\) series of the transition elements resemble with the properties of the elements of \(5 d\) series of the transition elements.
64. (c) : As sixth period can accommodate only 18 elements in the table, 14 members of \(4 f\) series (atomic number 58 to 71 ) are separately accommodated in a horizontal row below the periodic table. These are called as lanthanides.
65. (b) : On going from \(\mathrm{La}^{3+}\) to \(\mathrm{Lu}^{3+}\), the ionic radius shrinks from \(1.15 \AA\) to \(0.93 \AA\) (lanthanide contraction). The radius of \(\mathrm{La}^{3+}\) is also larger than that of \(\mathrm{Y}^{3+}\) ion which lies immediately above it in periodic table.
66. (a) : The general electronic structure of lanthanides is, \((n-2) f^{1-14}(n-1) s^{2} p^{6} d^{0-1} n s^{2}\).
67. (a) : \(\mathrm{La}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}\) is more basic than \(\mathrm{Lu}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}\). In lanthanides, the basic character of hydroxides decreases as the ionic radius decreases.
68. (a) : Due to lanthanide contraction, the elements of second and third transition series i.e., Zr and Hf resemble more with each other than the elements of first and second transition series.
69. (d) : Ionic radii of trivalent lanthanides decreases with increase in atomic number.
70. (c) : Early actinoids have low ionisation enthalpy than early lanthanoids because \(5 f\) electrons have more effective shielding from nuclear charge than \(4 f\) electrons.
71. (c)
72. (b) : Actinoids have a greater range of oxidation states due to comparable energies of \(5 f, 6 d\) and \(7 s\) orbitals. Hence, all their electrons can take part in bond formation.
73. (c) : U exhibits \(+3,+4,+5,+6\)

The exhibits \(+3,+4\); Ac exhibits +3 only
Pa exhibits \(+3,+4,+5\)
74. (d) : 'La' forms compounds in which its oxidation no. is +3 .
'Eu' and 'Gd' exhibit +2 as well as +3 oxidation states and not higher than that, due to stable \(\left(f^{7}\right)\) configuration. Whereas 'Am' exhibits the oxidation states \(+3,+4,+5,+6\), etc. due to extremely large size and low ionisation energy.
75. (c) : Copper is used for oxidation of alcohol. Zinc is used for galvanising iron.
76. (a)
77. (b) : \(\mathrm{HgCl}_{2(a q)}+4 \mathrm{I}_{(a q)}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{HgI}_{4(a q)}^{2-}+2 \mathrm{Cl}_{(a q)}^{-} \mathrm{I}_{2(s)}+\mathrm{I}_{(a q)}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{I}_{3(a q)}^{-}\)
78. (c)
79. (c) : When calomel reacts with \(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}\), it turns black due to the formation of a mixture of mercury and ammonium basic mercury (II) chloride.
\(\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH} \rightarrow \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{Hg}+\mathrm{HgNH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}\) (Calomel)
80. (b) : AgBr is highly photosensitive and is used as an ingredient for photographic films and plates.

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (c) : A complex salt is defined as a compound composed of a central metal atom having coordination bonds with ligands around it. While, double salts are defined as the ionic compounds that are formed by the combination of two different salt compounds.
Complex salt is \(\mathrm{K}_{2}\left[\mathrm{Pt}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]\).
Double salt is \(\mathrm{KAl}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{2} \cdot 12 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) (potash alum).
2. (b) : \(\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}\right] \mathrm{Cl}_{3}+3 \mathrm{AgNO}_{3} \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{AgCl} \downarrow\)
\[
+\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}\right]\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3}
\]
\(\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{5} \mathrm{Cl}\right] \mathrm{Cl}_{2}+2 \mathrm{AgNO}_{3} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{AgCl} \downarrow+\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{5} \mathrm{Cl}\right]\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right] \mathrm{Cl}+\mathrm{AgNO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{AgCl} \downarrow+\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right] \mathrm{NO}_{3}\)
3. (c) : For octahedral complexes, coordination number is 6. Hence, \(\mathrm{CoCl}_{3} \cdot 3 \mathrm{NH}_{3}\).i.e., \(\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{Cl}_{3}\right]\) will not ionise and will not give test for \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)ion with silver nitrate.
4. (c) : \(\left[\mathrm{Cr}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{4} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right] \mathrm{Cl}+\mathrm{AgNO}_{3} \rightarrow\left[\mathrm{Cr}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{4} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right] \mathrm{NO}_{3} +\mathrm{AgCl}\) ppt.
No. of millimoles of solution \(=100 \mathrm{~mL} \times 0.01 \mathrm{M}\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
& =1 \text { millimole } \\
& =10^{-3} \text { mole }
\end{aligned}
\]

So, mole of \(\mathrm{AgCl}=0.001\)
5. (a) : Ionic conductance increases with increasing the number of ions, produced after decomposition.

\begin{tabular}{lc} 
Compound & No. of ions produced \\
\(\mathrm{K}_{4}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]\) & 5 \\
{\(\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}\right] \mathrm{Cl}_{3}\)} & 4 \\
{\(\left[\mathrm{Cu}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4}\right] \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\)} & 3 \\
{\(\left[\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{CO})_{4}\right]\)} & 0
\end{tabular}
6. (a) : As the complex gives two moles of AgCl ppt. with \(\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}\) solution, so the complex must have two ionisable Cl atoms. Hence, the probable complex, which gives three mole ions may be \(\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{5} \mathrm{NO}_{2}\right] \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\).
\(\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{5} \mathrm{NO}_{2}\right] \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \rightarrow\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{5} \mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)
one mole \(\rightarrow 3\) mole ions
7. (a) : Complexes in which a metal is bound to only one kind of donor groups e.g., \(\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}\right]^{3+}\) are known as homoleptic. Complexes in which a metal is bound to more than
one kind of donor groups, e.g., \(\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]^{2+}\) are known as heteroleptic.
8. (a) : Chelating ligands (e.g., en) form more stable complexes than unidentate ligands.
9. (b) : Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (EDTA \({ }^{4-}\) ) is an important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two nitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion.
10. (b) : The intensity of the trans-effect (as measured by the increase in rate of substitution of the trans ligand) follows the sequence: \(\mathrm{CN}^{-}>\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}^{-}>\mathrm{Br}^{-}>\mathrm{NH}_{3}\)
11. (d) : \(\left[M(e n)_{2}\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right)\right] \mathrm{Cl}\) :

Oxidation number of metal \(=+3\)
Coordination number of metal \(=6\)
∴ Sum of oxidation number and coordination number \(=3+6=9\)
12. (c) : The ligand acetylacetone forms six membered chelate ring in the complex \(\left[\mathrm{Co}(\mathrm{acac})_{3}\right]\).
13. (b) : Bond energy of \(\mathrm{F}_{2}\) is less than \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\) due to interelectronic repulsions in small sized F -atoms.
Silicon exhibits coordination number 6.
In aqueous state, \(\mathrm{Mn}(\mathrm{II})\) is more stable.
\[
\mathrm{Mn} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+2 e^{-}
\]

The common oxidation states of \(15^{\text {th }}\) group elements are \(-3,+3\) and +5 .
14. (b) : \(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}^{2-} \rightarrow\) bidentate ligand.

3 molecules attached from two sides with Ni makes coordination number 6 .

As the number of atoms of the ligands that are directly bound to the central metal is known as coordination number. It is six here (see in figure).
Oxidation state : Let oxidation state of Cr be \(x\).
\(\Rightarrow x+3(-2)=-3 \Rightarrow 3+x-6=0\)
\(\Rightarrow x=+3\)
16. (d) : When a ligand has two groups that are capable of bonding to the central atom, it is said to be bidentate. Thus, the only ligand, which is expected to be bidentate is \(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}{ }^{2-}\) as
<smiles>O=C([O-])C(=O)[O-]</smiles>
17. (c): Complexes in which a metal is bounded to only one kind of ligand are known as homoleptic complexes. Potassium trioxalatoaluminate(III), \(\mathrm{K}_{3}\left[\mathrm{Al}\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right)_{3}\right]\) is an example of homoleptic complex.

22. (a) : The ligands are named in the alphabetic order according to latest IUPAC system. So, the name of \(\left[\mathrm{Pt}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{Br}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right) \mathrm{Cl}\right] \mathrm{Cl}\) is triamminebromochloronitroplatin um(IV) chloride. (The oxidation no. of 'Pt' is +4 ).
23. (d) : The formula of dichlorobis(urea)copper(II) is \(\left[\mathrm{CuCl}_{2}\left\{\left(\mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)_{2} \mathrm{CO}\right\}_{2}\right]\).
24. (a) : A-(II), B-(III), C-(IV), D-(I)

38．（c）：\(\left[\mathrm{Fe}\left(\mathrm{PPh}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{NH}_{3} \mathrm{ClBr}\right] \mathrm{Cl}\) can give two optical and two geometrical isomers．While other complexes do not form geometrical isomers．

\(n=4, \mu=\sqrt{4(4+2)}=\sqrt{24}=4.90\) B．M．
45．（a）：According to spectrochemical series，order of increasing field strength is ：
\[
\mathrm{SCN}^{-}<\mathrm{F}^{-}<\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}^{2-}<\mathrm{CN}^{-}
\]

46．（c）：In \(\mathrm{K}_{4}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]\) complex， Fe is in +2 oxidation state．
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-166.jpg?height=84&width=423&top_left_y=1228&top_left_x=137)

As \(\mathrm{CN}^{-}\)is a strong field ligand，it causes pairing of electrons therefore，electronic configuration of \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\) in \(\mathrm{K}_{4}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]\) is \(t_{2 g}{ }^{6} e_{g}^{0}\) ．
47．（a）
48．（d）：\(\Delta_{t}=\frac{4}{9} \Delta_{o}=\frac{4}{9} \times 18000=8000 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\)
49．（b）： \(\mathrm{Ni}(28):[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{8} 4 s^{2}\)
\(\because \quad \mathrm{CO}\) is a strong field ligand，so，unpaired electrons get paired． \(s p^{3}\) hybridisation
In \(\left[\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{CO})_{4}\right]:\)\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}

Thus，the complex is \(s p^{3}\) hybridised with tetrahedral geometry and diamagnetic in nature．
50．（d）：Increasing order of crystal field splitting energy is ： \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}<\mathrm{NH}_{3}<\) en
Thus，increasing order of crystal field splitting energy for the given complexes is ：
\(\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{6}\right]^{3+}<\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}\right]^{3+}<\left[\mathrm{Co}(\text { en })_{3}\right]^{3+}\)
As，\(E=\frac{h c}{\lambda}\)
Thus，increasing order of wavelength of absorption is ：
\(\left[\mathrm{Co}(\text { en })_{3}\right]^{3+}<\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}\right]^{3+}<\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{6}\right]^{3+}\)

51．（b）：\(\left[\mathrm{Mn}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]^{3-}\) ：Let oxidation state of Mn be \(x\) ．
\[
x+6 \times(-1)=-3 \Rightarrow x=+3
\]

Electronic configuration of \(\mathrm{Mn}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 4 s^{2} 3 d^{5}\)
Electronic configuration of \(\mathrm{Mn}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{4}\)
\(\mathrm{CN}^{-}\)is a strong field ligand thus，it causes pairing of electrons in 3d－orbital．
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-166.jpg?height=165&width=697&top_left_y=461&top_left_x=1014)

Thus，\(\left[\mathrm{Mn}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]^{3-}\) has \(d^{2} s p^{3}\) hybridisation and has octahedral geometry．
52．（b）：Jahn－Teller distortion is usually significant for asymmetrically occupied \(e_{g}\) orbitals since they are directed towards the ligands and the energy gain is considerably more．
In case of unevenly occupied \(t_{2 g}\) orbitals，the Jahn－Teller distortion is very weak since the \(t_{2 g}\) set does not point directly at the ligands and therefore，the energy gain is much less．
High spin complexes ：

Pairing of electrons in \(d\)－orbital takes place due to the presence of strong field ligand（ \(\mathrm{CN}^{-}\)）．
54．（b）： \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) is a weak field ligand，hence \(\Delta_{o}<\) pairing energy．
CFSE \(=(-0.4 x+0.6 y) \Delta_{o}\)
where，\(x\) and \(y\) are no．of electrons occupying \(t_{2 g}\) and \(e_{g}\) orbitals respectively．

\(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\left(3 d^{5}\right)=t^{3}{ }_{2 g} e_{g}{ }^{2}=-0.4 \times 3+0.6 \times 2=0.0\) or \(0 \Delta_{0}\)
55．（c）：Oxidation state of Cu in \(\left[\mathrm{Cu}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4}\right]^{2+}\) is +2
\(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}=3 d^{9}\) 倘｜仆｜仆｜仆｜
It has one unpaired electron \((n=1)\) ．
\(\mu=\sqrt{n(n+2)}=\sqrt{1(1+2)}=\sqrt{3}=1.73 \mathrm{BM}\)
56．（b）： \(\mathrm{CFSE}=(-0.4 x+0.6 y) \Delta_{o}\)
where，\(x=\) No．of electrons occupying \(t_{2 g}\) orbitals
\(y=\) no．of electrons occupying \(e_{g}\) orbitals
\(=(-0.4 \times 3+0.6 \times 1) \Delta_{0} \quad\left[\because\right.\) High spin \(\left.d^{4}=t_{2 g}^{3} e_{g}^{1}\right]\)
\(=(-1.2+0.6) \Delta_{o}=-0.6 \Delta_{o}\)
57．（c）： \(\mathrm{Co}^{2+}\) in \(\left[\mathrm{CoBr}_{4}\right]^{2-}\) has \(3 d^{7} 4 s^{0}\) configuration and \(\mathrm{Br}^{-}\) is a weak field ligand．Thus，it has 3 unpaired electrons and hence，paramagnetic．
58. (b) : In \(\left[\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{CN})_{4}\right]^{2-}\), all orbitals are doubly occupied, hence, it is diamagnetic.

where \(x=\) number of electrons occupying \(t_{2 g}\) orbital
\(y=\) number of electrons occupying \(e_{g}\) orbital
\(z=\) number of pairs of electrons
For low spin \(d^{6}\) complex electronic configuration
\[
\begin{aligned}

& =\frac{-12}{5} \Delta_{o}+3 P

61. (c) : \(\left[\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{dmg})_{2}\right]\) is square planar in structure not tetrahedral.

Number of unpaired electrons \(=2\)
Hence, \(\left[\mathrm{NiCl}_{4}\right]^{2-}\) is paramagnetic.

Number of unpaired electrons \(=0\), so it is diamagnetic in nature.

No. of unpaired electron \(=1\), so it is paramagnetic.

No. of unpaired electrons \(=4\), so it is paramagnetic.
63. (c) : \(\left[\mathrm{Mn}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{6}\right]^{2+}: \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}=3 d^{5}\)
∴ Number of unpaired electrons \(=5\)
\[
\left[\mathrm{Fe}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{6}\right]^{2+}: \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}=3 d^{6}

\(\therefore \quad\) Number of unpaired electrons \(=4\)
\[
\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{6}\right]^{2+}: \mathrm{Co}^{2+}=3 d^{7}

\(\therefore \quad\) Number of unpaired electrons \(=3\)
\[
\left[\mathrm{Cr}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{6}\right]^{2+}: \mathrm{Cr}^{2+}=3 d^{4}
\]
\(\therefore \quad\) Number of unpaired electrons \(=4\)
Minimum paramagnetic behaviour is shown by \(\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{6}\right]^{2+}\).
64. (b) : \(\mathrm{Ti}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{2} 4 s^{2}, \mathrm{Ti}^{3+}:[\mathrm{Ar}] 3 d^{1} 4 s^{0}\)

65. (a) : A transition metal complex absorbs visible light only if it has unpaired electrons.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-167.jpg?height=232&width=709&top_left_y=589&top_left_x=1112)

No unpaired electron so does not absorb visible light.

CFSE \(=3(-0.4) \Delta_{o}+0.6 \Delta_{o}=-1.2 \Delta_{o}+0.6 \Delta_{o}=-0.6 \Delta_{o}\)
67. (b) : A species is coloured when it contains unpaired \(d\)-electrons which are capable of undergoing \(d\) - \(d\) transition on adsorption of light of a particular wavelength.
In \(\mathrm{TiF}_{6}{ }^{2-}, \mathrm{Ti}^{4+}: 3 d^{0}, \quad\) colourless
In \(\mathrm{CoF}_{6}{ }^{3-}, \mathrm{Co}^{3+}: 3 d^{6}, \quad\) coloured
In \(\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}, \mathrm{Cu}^{+}: 3 d^{10}, \quad\) colourless
In \(\mathrm{NiCl}_{4}{ }^{2-}, \mathrm{Ni}^{2+}: 3 d^{8}, \quad\) coloured
Thus, \(\mathrm{TiF}_{6}{ }^{2-}\left(3 d^{0}\right)\) and \(\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\left(3 d^{10}\right)\) with empty and fully filled \(d\)-orbitals appear colourless as they are not capable of undergoing \(d-d\) transition.

Transition metal ions containing completely filled \(d\)-orbitals or empty \(d\)-orbitals are colourless species.
Thus, only \(\left[\mathrm{Cr}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}\right]^{3+}\) having unpaired electron absorb visible light and is coloured.
69. (a)
70. (a) : When the ligands are arranged in order of the magnitude of crystal field splitting, the arrangement, thus, obtained is called spectrochemical series.
Arranged in increasing field strength as
\(\mathrm{I}^{-}<\mathrm{Br}^{-}<\mathrm{Cl}^{-}<\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}<\mathrm{F}^{-}<\mathrm{OH}^{-}<\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}^{2-}<\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}<\mathrm{NH}_{3}<\) en
\(<\mathrm{NO}_{2}{ }^{-}<\mathrm{CN}^{-}<\mathrm{CO}\)
It has been observed that ligands before \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) are weak field ligands while ligands after \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) are strong field ligands.

CFSE in octahedral field depends upon the nature of ligands. Stronger the ligands larger will be the value of \(\Delta_{\text {oct }}\).

Greater the number of unpaired electrons, higher is the paramagnetism. Hence, \(\left[\mathrm{Ni}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{6}\right]^{2+}\) will exhibit the minimum paramagnetic behaviour.
72. (d) : Magnetic moment \(=\sqrt{n(n+2)}\)

75. (b) : Cyanide ion is strong field ligand because it is a pseudohalide ion. Pseudohalide ions are stronger coordinating ligands and they have the ability to form \(\sigma\)-bond (from the pseudohalide to the metal) and \(\pi\) bond (from the metal to pseudohalide).

In presence of weak field ligand, there will be no pairing of electrons. So, it will form a high spin complex, i.e., the number of unpaired electrons \(=5\).

Thus, the number of unpaired electrons \(=4\).
79. (d) : Odd electrons, ions and molecules are paramagnetic. In \(\mathrm{Cr}(\mathrm{CO})_{6}\) molecule 12 electrons are contributed by CO group and it contains no odd electron.
Cr : \(3 d^{5} 4 s^{1}\)
\(\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CO})_{5}\) molecule also does not contain odd electron.
Fe : \(3 d^{6} 4 s^{2}\)
In \(\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]^{4-}\) ion, \(\mathrm{Fe}(+2): 3 d^{6} 4 s^{0}\)
∴ No odd electrons.
In \(\left[\mathrm{Cr}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}\right]^{3+}\) ion, \(\mathrm{Cr}(+3): 3 d^{3} 4 s^{0}\)
This ion contains odd electron so it is paramagnetic.
80. (a) : \(\mathrm{InNi}(\mathrm{CO})_{4}\) complex, \(\mathrm{Ni}(0)\) will have \(3 d^{10}\) configuration.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-168.jpg?height=180&width=698&top_left_y=1573&top_left_x=991)

Hence, \(\left[\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{CO})_{4}\right]\) will have tetrahedral geometry and diamagnetic as there are no unpaired electrons.
81. (b) : Based on the number of metal atoms present in a complex, they are classified as :
e.g., : \(\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CO})_{5}\) : mononuclear; \(\mathrm{Co}_{2}(\mathrm{CO})_{8}\) : dinuclear ; \(\mathrm{Fe}_{3}(\mathrm{CO})_{12}\) : trinuclear
82. (a) : In sigma bonded organometallic complexes, the metal atom and carbon atom of the ligand are joined together with a sigma bond, i.e., ligand contributes one electron and is therefore, called one electron donor, e.g., Grignard's reagent \(R-\mathrm{Mg}-X\).
83. (a) : The greater the negative charge on the carbonyl complex, the more easy it would be for the metal to permit its electrons to participate in the back bonding, the higher would be the \(M-\mathrm{C}\) bond order and simultaneously there would be larger reduction in the \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}\) bond order. Thus, \(\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CO})_{4}\right]^{2-}\) has the lowest \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}\) bond order means the longest bond length.
84. (a) : The presence of positive charge on the metal carbonyl would resist the flow of the metal electron charge to \(\pi^{*}\) orbitals
of CO. This would increase the CO bond order and hence, CO in a metal carbonyl cation would absorb at a higher frequency compared to its absorption in a neutral metal carbonyl.
85. (a) : \(\mathrm{Al}\left(\mathrm{OC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)_{3}\) contains bonding through O and thus it does not have metal - carbon bond.
86. (d) : \(\pi\)-bonded organometallic compound includes organometallic compounds of alkenes, alkynes and some other carbon containing compounds having electrons in their \(p\)-orbitals.
87. (c) : \(\left[\mathrm{Co}(\mathrm{CO})_{5} \mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{2+}\) : In this complex, Co-atom is attached with \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\) through \(\sigma\) bonding and with CO through dative \(\pi\)-bond.
88. (c)
89. (d) : In \(M(\mathrm{CO})_{4}\), metal is bonded to the ligands via carbon atoms with both \(\sigma\) and \(\pi\)-bond character. Both metal to ligand and ligand to metal bonding are possible.
90. (b)
91. (c) : First cupric cyanide is formed which decomposes to give cuprous cyanide and cyanogen gas. Cuprous cyanide dissolves in excess of potassium cyanide to form a complex, potassium cyanide \(\mathrm{K}_{3}\left[\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{CN})_{4}\right]\).
\(\left[\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{KCN} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{CN})_{2}+\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\right] \times 2\)
\(2 \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{CN})_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}_{2}(\mathrm{CN})_{2}+(\mathrm{CN})_{2}\)
\(\mathrm{Cu}_{2}(\mathrm{CN})_{2}+6 \mathrm{KCN} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{~K}_{3} \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{CN})_{4}\)
\(2 \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}+10 \mathrm{KCN} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{~K}_{3} \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{CN})_{4}+2 \mathrm{~K}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}+(\mathrm{CN})_{2}\)
92. (c) : cis-platin, is cis- \(\left[\mathrm{PtCl}_{2}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{2}\right]\) is used as an anticancer agent.
93. (d) : Copper being more electropositive readily precipitate silver from their salt \(\left(\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right)\)solution.
\(\mathrm{Cu}+2 \mathrm{AgNO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2}+\mathrm{Ag}\)
In \(\mathrm{K}\left[\mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{CN})_{2}\right]\) solution, a complex anion \(\left[\mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{CN})_{2}\right]^{-}\)is formed so \(\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\)ions are less available in the solution and Cu cannot displace Ag from this complex ion.
94. (b) : Copper sulphate reacts with potassium cyanide giving a white precipitate of cuprous cyanide and cyanogen gas. The cuprous cyanide dissolves in excess of KCN forming potassium cuprocyanide \(\mathrm{K}_{3}\left[\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{CN})_{4}\right]\).
\(2 \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}+4 \mathrm{KCN} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{CuCN}+(\mathrm{CN})_{2}+2 \mathrm{~K}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\)
\(\mathrm{CuCN}+3 \mathrm{KCN} \rightarrow \mathrm{K}_{3}\left[\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{CN})_{4}\right]\)
95. (c) : Undecomposed AgBr forms a soluble complex with hypo and the reaction is given as :
\(\mathrm{AgBr}+2 \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{3}\left[\mathrm{Ag}\left(\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)_{2}\right]+\mathrm{NaBr}\)

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (a) : The compound where halogen group is attached to a \(s p^{3}\) hybridised carbon atom next to the carbon which is adjacent to carbon-carbon double bond is known as allylic halide. Hence, the given molecule allylic halide.
<smiles>[X]C(C=Cc1ccccc1)CC</smiles>
is an
2. (c) : The correct order of bond enthalpy is
\(\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{F}>\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{Cl}>\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{Br}>\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{I}\)
3. (c) :
<smiles>CCCC(CCc1ccc(C(Br)CC)cc1)[C+]1C=CC(C=Cc2ccccc2)CC1</smiles>
4. (c) : Tertiary halide shows \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1\) mechanism i.e., ionic mechanism. In the given reaction negative ion will attack on carbocation. Thus greater the tendency of ionisation (greater ionic character in \(M-\mathrm{F}\) bond) more favourable will be reaction. The most ionic bond is \(\mathrm{Rb}-\mathrm{F}\) in the given examples thus most favourable reaction will be with \(\mathrm{Rb}-\mathrm{F}\).
5. (b) : \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{2} \xrightarrow[-\mathrm{HCl}]{\mathrm{Cl}_{2}, 400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}} \mathrm{ClCH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}\)

At \(400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) temperature, substitution occurs instead of addition.
6. (a) : Arenes react with halogens in the presence of a Lewis acid like anhydrous \(\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}, \mathrm{FeBr}_{3}\) or \(\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}\) to yield haloarenes, e.g.,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-175.jpg?height=200&width=540&top_left_y=2293&top_left_x=1110)
7. (d) : Rate of \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1\) reaction increases as the stability of carbocation formed, increases.
8. (a) :

Rate of dehydrohalogenation of the alkyl halides depends on the stability of the alkene formed. Alkene formed in case (i) is most stable (conjugated diene), followed by (iii), which is a more substituted alkene. The alkene formed in case (ii) is least stable as it is least substituted.
∴ Rate of dehydrohalogenation : (ii) < (iii) < (i)
11. (c) : In (A), (C) and (D), nitrile is formed as the major product.
\(R-X+\mathrm{AgCN} \rightarrow R-\mathrm{NC}\)
Alkyl isocyanide
(or isonitrile)
12. (c) : Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. Enantiomers possess identical physical properties namely, melting point, boiling point, refractive index, etc. They only differ with respect to the rotation of plane polarised light. If one of the enantiomer is dextrorotatory, then other will be laevorotatory.
13. (b) : It is an example of \(\beta\)-elimination, as the major product is 2-pentene (more substituted) not 1-pentene, hence it follows Saytzeff's rule.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-176.jpg?height=344&width=590&top_left_y=1827&top_left_x=244)

(More substituted alkene is formed, Zaitsev's rule)
15. (a) : Aryl halides are less reactive as compared to alkyl halides as the halogen atom in these compounds is firmly attached and cannot be replaced by nucleophiles such as \(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\), \(\mathrm{NH}_{2}^{-}\), etc. In chlorobenzene, the electron pair of chlorine atom is in conjugation with \(\pi\)-electrons of benzene ring. Thus \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Cl}\) bond acquires double bond character and is difficult to break.

19. (c) : The reaction,
\(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Br}+\mathrm{NaCN} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CN}+\mathrm{NaBr}\)
follows \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2\) mechanism which is favoured by polar aprotic solvent i.e., \(N, N^{\prime}\)-dimethylformamide (DMF),
<smiles>CN(C)C=O</smiles>
20. (d) : o-Substituted biphenyls are optically active as both the rings are not in one plane and their mirror images are non-superimposable.

Saturated compound is converted into unsaturated compound by removal of group of atoms hence, it is an elimination reaction.

-Br group is replaced by -OH group hence, it is a substitution reaction.

Addition of \(\mathrm{Br}_{2}\) converts an unsaturated compound into a saturated compound hence, it is an addition reaction.
22. (b) :
<smiles>CC(OC(C)C(C(=O)O)C(C)O)C(=O)O</smiles>
23. (a) : In case of optically active alkyl halides, \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1\) reaction is accompanied by racemisation. The carbocation formed in the slow step being \(s p^{2}\) hybridised is planar and attack of nucleophile may take place from either side resulting in a mixture of products, one having the same configuration and other having inverted configuration.
The isomer corresponding to inversion is present in slight excess because \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1\) also depends upon the degree of shielding of the front side of the reacting carbon.
24. (None) : Due to chirality
<smiles>CCC(C)(Cl)C(C)C</smiles>
, only compound
(iv) will undergo racemisation.

Hence, all the given options are incorrect.
25. (b) : I and II are staggered and eclipsed conformers.
26. (a) : Maleic acid shows geometrical isomerism and not optical isomerism.
<smiles>O=C(O)/C=C\C(=O)O</smiles>
27. (c) : If reaction is \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1\), there will be formation of carbocation and the rearrangement takes place. In these reactions there is no rearrangement hence both are \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2\) mechanism.
28. (a) : Electron withdrawing groups like \(-\mathrm{NO}_{2}\) facilitates nucleophilic substitution reaction in chlorobenzene.
29. (c) : \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1\) reactions proceed via the formation of a carbocation intermediate.
More stable is the carbocation more reactive is the alkyl/aryl halide towards \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1\).
In \(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{C}^{+}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)\) carbocation, the two phenyl rings by their +R effect and \(-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) by its +I effect diminish the positive charge and make it stable.
<smiles>C[C](c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1</smiles>
30. (a) : I \(<\) II \(<\) IV \(<\) III

The order of reactivity is dependent on the stability of the intermediate carbocation formed by cleavage of \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{X}\) bond. The \(3^{\circ}\) carbocation (formed from III) will be more stable than
its \(2^{\circ}\) counter part (formed from IV) which in turn will be more stable than the arenium ion (formed from I). Also, the aryl halide has a double bond character in the \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{X}\) bond which makes the cleavage more difficult. However, inspite of all the stated factors, II will be more reactive than I due to the presence of the electron withdrawing \(-\mathrm{NO}_{2}\) group. \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{X}\) bond becomes weak and undergoes nucleophilic substitution reaction.
31. (c) :

32. (d)
33. (c) : The given compound may be written as
<smiles>CC=CC[C+](C)Br</smiles>

Both geometrical isomerism (cis-trans form) and optical isomerism is possible in the given compound.
No. of optical isomer \(=2^{n}=2^{1}=2\)
(where \(n=\) no. of asymmetric carbon)
Hence total no. of stereoisomers \(=2+2=4\)
34. (b) : \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2\) mechanism is followed in case of primary and secondary alkyl halides i.e. \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2\) reaction is favoured by small groups on the carbon atoms attached to halogen so, \(\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{X}>\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{X}>\mathrm{R}_{2} \mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{X}>\mathrm{R}_{3} \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{X}\).
Primary alkyl halide is more reactive than secondary and tertiary alkyl halides.
35. (a) : Meso compound does not rotate plane polarised light. Compound which contains tetrahedral atoms with four different groups but the whole molecule is achiral, is known as meso compound. It possesses a plane of symmetry and is optically inactive. One of the asymmetric carbon atoms turns the plane of polarised light to the right and other to the left and to the same extent so that the rotation due to upper half is compensated by the lower half, i.e., internally compensated, and finally there is no rotation of plane polarised light.

40. (b) : The non-reactivity of the chlorine atom in vinyl chloride can be explained from the molecular orbital point of view as follows. If the chlorine atom has \(s p^{2}\) hybridisation, the \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Cl}\) bond will be a \(\sigma\)-bond and the two lone pairs of electrons would occupy the other two \(s p^{2}\) orbitals. This would leave a \(p\) orbital containing a lone pair, and this orbital could now conjugate with the \(\pi\)-bond of the ethylenic link. Thus two M.O's will be required to accommodate these four \(\pi\)-electrons. Furthermore, since chlorine is more electronegative than carbon, the electrons will tend to be found in the vicinity of the chlorine atom. Nevertheless, the chlorine atom has now lost full control of the lone pair and so, is less negative than it would have been had there been no conjugation. Since two carbon atoms have acquired a share in the lone pair, each carbon atom acquires a small negative charge. Hence, owing to delocalisation of bonds (through conjugation), the vinyl chloride molecule has an increased stability. Before the chlorine atom can be displaced by some other group, the lone pair must be localised again on the chlorine atom. This requires energy, and so the chlorine is more firmly bound.

41. (a) : These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are enantiomers.
42. (b) : \(\mathrm{I}>\mathrm{Br}>\mathrm{Cl}>\mathrm{F} \longrightarrow\) atomic radii
\(\mathrm{F}, \mathrm{Cl}, \mathrm{Br}, \mathrm{I}\) belong to the same group orderly. Atomic radii go on increasing as the nuclear charge increases in preceding downwards in a group. The decreasing order of bond length \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{I}>\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Br}>\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Cl}>\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{F}\). The order of bond dissociation energy \(R-\mathrm{F}>R-\mathrm{Cl}>R-\mathrm{Br}>R-\) I. During dehydrohalogenation \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{I}\) bond breaks more easily than \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{F}\) bond. So reactivity order of halides is, \(R-\mathrm{I}>R-\mathrm{Br}>R-\mathrm{Cl}>R-\mathrm{F}\).

46. (a) : Organic compounds exhibit the property of enantiomerism (optical isomerism) only when their molecules are chiral. Most chiral compounds have a chiral centre, which is an atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.

5. (d)
6. (c) : Electron withdrawing groups (e.g. \(-\mathrm{NO}_{2}\) ) stabilise the phenoxide ion more by dispersing the negative charge relative to phenol (i.e. release of proton becomes easy) and thus, increase the acidic strength of phenols. The particular effect is more when the substituent is present on \(o\) - and \(p\)-positions than in \(m\)-position to the phenolic group. Thus, acidic strength of nitrophenols decreases in the order :
\(p\)-nitrophenol > o-nitrophenol > \(m\)-nitrophenol > phenol.
7. (c) : Tertiary alcohols are most reactive and immediately produce turbidity at room temperature while primary alcohols do not react with Lucas reagent at room temperature.

21. (a) : Since, phenols and carboxylic acids are more acidic than aliphatic alcohols, we find that cyclohexanol (I) is least acidic. Out of the two given phenols, III is more acidic than IV. This is because of the presence of three highly electron withdrawing \(-\mathrm{NO}_{2}\) groups on the benzene ring which makes the \(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{H}\) bond extremely polarized. This facilitates the release of H as \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\). Thus, III > IV.

In acetic acid, the electron withdrawing
<smiles>[B]C(C)=O</smiles>
in the -COOH group polarises the \(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{H}\) bond and increases the acidic strength. Acetic acid is therefore more acidic than phenol or cyclohexanol.
\(\therefore \quad\) The order of acidic character is III \(>\mathrm{II}>\mathrm{IV}>\mathrm{I}\).
22. (b) : Phenol is most acidic of all the given compounds.

In phenol, the electron withdrawing phenyl ring polarizes the \(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{H}\) bond, thereby facilitating the release of H as \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)and hence, phenol is most acidic.

In
<smiles>OCc1ccccc1</smiles>
the electron withdrawing effect of phenyl ring is somewhat diminished by the \(-\mathrm{CH}_{2}\) group and it is therefore, less acidic than phenol. In (c) and (d), - OH group is attached to alkyl groups which, due to their \(+I\) effect reduce the polarity of -OH bond and so, the acidic strength is low.
23. (a) : In phenols, the presence of electron releasing groups decrease the acidity, whereas presence of electron withdrawing groups increase the acidity, compared to phenol. Among the meta and para-nitrophenols, the later is more acidic as the presence of \(-\mathrm{NO}_{2}\) group at para position stabilises the phenoxide ion to a greater extent than when it is present at meta position. Thus, correct order of acidity is :
para-nitrophenol > meta-nitrophenol > phenol > methyl phenol
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

26. (c) : When 1,2-diol like ethylene glycol is treated with \(\mathrm{HIO}_{4}\), each alcoholic group is oxidised to a carbonyl group by \(\mathrm{HIO}_{4}\). Since in glycol, both the -OH groups are terminal, so oxidation would yield two formaldehyde molecules.

29. (c) : Phenols are much more acidic than alcohols, due to the stabilisation of phenoxide ion by resonance.

\(-\mathrm{NO}_{2}\) is the electron withdrawing group and helps in stabilizing the negative charge on the oxygen hence equilibrium shifts in forward direction and more \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)ions remove easily. Hence, it is most acidic.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-188.jpg?height=177&width=597&top_left_y=970&top_left_x=1117)
\(-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) is the electron donating group. Hence, electron density increases on the oxygen and destabilizes the product. Thus, equilibrium shifts in backward direction.
30. (c) : Formation of a yellow precipitate on heating a compound with an alkaline solution of iodine is known as iodoform reaction. Methyl alcohol does not respond to this test. Iodoform test is exhibited by ethyl alcohol, acetaldehyde, acetone, methyl ketones and those alcohols which possess \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}(\mathrm{OH})\) - group.
31. (c) : n-Propyl alcohol on oxidation with potassium dichromate gives an aldehyde which on further oxidation gives an acid. Both aldehyde and acid contain the same number of \(C\) atoms as the original alcohol.

Isopropyl alcohol on oxidation gives a ketone with the same number of \(C\) atoms as the original alcohol.

32. (b) : This reaction is called Reimer-Tiemann reaction.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-188.jpg?height=186&width=666&top_left_y=2133&top_left_x=977)

Iodoform is a pale yellow solid which crystallises in hexagonal plates.
34. (b) : Phenol exists as a resonance hybrid of the following structures.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-189.jpg?height=174&width=698&top_left_y=443&top_left_x=287)

Thus, due to resonance the oxygen atom of the -OH group acquires a positive charge and hence attracts electron pair of the \(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{H}\) bond leading to the release of hydrogen atom as proton.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-189.jpg?height=184&width=369&top_left_y=778&top_left_x=461)

Once the phenoxide ion is formed it stabilises itself by resonance which is more stable than the parent phenol as there is no charge separation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-189.jpg?height=158&width=679&top_left_y=1087&top_left_x=306)

Effect of substituent : Presence of electron withdrawing groups \(\left(-\mathrm{NO}_{2},-X,-\mathrm{CN}\right)\) increase the acidity of phenols while the presence of electron releasing groups ( \(-\mathrm{NH}_{2},-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) ) decrease the acidity of phenols. This explains the following order of acidity :
p-nitrophenol > phenol > p-cresol.

39. (a)
40. (d) : \(-\mathrm{OCH}_{3},-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) are electron donating groups and decrease the acidic character of phenols. \(-\mathrm{NO}_{2}\), is electron withdrawing group and tends to increase the acidic character. Electron donating effect of \(-\mathrm{OCH}_{3}\) group ( \(+R\) effect) is more than that of \(-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) group ( \(+I\) effect). Thus, the order is p-methoxyphenol < p-methylphenol < p-nitrophenol.
41. (b) : \(2^{\circ}\) alcohols on oxidation give ketones, \(1^{\circ}\) alcohols form aldehydes.

generates \(3^{\circ}\) carbocation which is (methylpropan-2-ol)

46. (d) : 2-Methylpropan-2-ol reacts rapidly with Lucas reagent at room temperature.

54. (a) : In \(\mathrm{Ph}-\underset{\dot{O}}{\ddot{O}}-\mathrm{H}\), the lone pair of oxygen is in conjugation with phenyl group so, it is least basic among the given compounds and is most difficult to protonate.
55. (a) : Ethers are readily attacked by HI to give an alkyl halide and alcohol. But when heated with excess of HI , the product alcohol first formed reacts further with HI to form the corresponding alkyl iodide.
\(R-\mathrm{O}-R^{\prime}+\underset{\text { (excess) }}{2 \mathrm{HI}} \xrightarrow{\text { Heat }} R \mathrm{I}+R^{\prime} \mathrm{I}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\)
56. (b) : In case of phenyl methyl ether, methyl phenyl oxonium ion \(\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}-\underset{\mathrm{H}}{\mathrm{O}}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)\) is formed by protonation of ether. The \(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) bond is weaker than \(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}\) bond as \(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}\) has partial double bond character. Therefore, the attack by \(\mathrm{I}^{-}\)ion breaks \(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) bond to form \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{I}\).

62. (c) : The alkyl iodide produced depends on the nature of the alkyl groups. If one group is Me and the other a primary or secondary alkyl group, it is methyl iodide which is produced. This can be explained on the assumption that the mechanism is \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2\), and because of the steric effect of the larger group, \(\mathrm{I}^{-}\) attacks the smaller methyl group.
When the substrate is a methyl \(t\)-alkyl ether, the products are \(t-\mathrm{RI}\) and MeOH . This can be explained by \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1\) mechanism, the carbonium ion produced being the \(t\)-alkyl since tertiary carbonium ion is more stable than a primary or secondary carbonium ion.
63. (a) : With cold HI, a mixture of alkyl iodide and alcohol is formed. In the case of mixed ethers, the halogen atom attaches to a smaller and less complex alkyl group.
\(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OCH}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2}+\mathrm{HI} \rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{I}+\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2} \mathrm{CHOH}\)
64. (d) : \(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}-\mathrm{Cl}+\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \longrightarrow\)
\(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}+\mathrm{NaCl}\)

The above reaction is called as Williamson's synthesis.
65. (a) : Diethyl ether is a saturated compound, so it is resistant to nucleophilic attack by a hydroxyl ion \(\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)\).
Other compounds have unsaturation and the unsaturated ' \(C\) ' atom bears partial +ve charge, therefore they undergo easy nucleophilic attack by \(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\)ion.
66. (d) : Ethers are very inert. The chemical inertness of ethers is due to absence of active group in their molecules. Since \(\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) is inert and it does not contain active group, therefore it does not react with sodium.
67. (a) : Phenetole is formed when sodium phenoxide is heated with ethyl iodide.

\(Y=\) Acetaldehyde
12. (a) : A tertiary alcohol is difficult to oxidise. But when it is treated with an acidic oxidising agent under some conditions, it is oxidised to ketone and then to acids. Both the ketone and acid the contain lesser number of carbon atoms than the starting alcohol.
13. (a) : The oxidation of toluene \(\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)\) with chromyl chloride \(\left(\mathrm{CrO}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right)\) in \(\mathrm{CCl}_{4}\) or \(\mathrm{CS}_{2}\) to give benzaldehyde is called Etard reaction. In this reaction, the chromyl chloride first forms a brown complex, which is separated and then decomposed with \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) to give benzaldehyde \(\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CHO}\right)\).
14. (a) : Both the given statements are correct.

24. (b) : Since, \(A\) gives silver mirror test, it must be an aldehyde and aldehydes are formed by oxidation of \(1^{\circ}\) alcohols. Thus, ' \(\mathrm{X'}\) is a \(1^{\circ}\) alcohol, i.e., \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OH}\).

31. (d) : Aromatic aldehydes are more reactive than alkyl aryl ketones. Electron withdrawing group ( \(-\mathrm{NO}_{2}\) ) increases the reactivity towards nucleophilic addition reactions whereas, electron donating group \(\left(-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)\) decreases the reactivity towards nucleophilic addition reactions.
Therefore, the order is :

37. (b) : Carbonyl group is reduced to \(-\mathrm{CH}_{2}\) group, when treated with amalgamated zinc and conc. HCl . This process is called Clemmensen's reduction.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-205.jpg?height=76&width=438&top_left_y=324&top_left_x=1315)
38. (d) : Greater the number of alkyl/phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl group, lower will be its reactivity.
\(+R\)-effect is stronger than \(+I\)-effect.
39. (b) : (a) Reimer-Tiemann reaction :
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-205.jpg?height=177&width=554&top_left_y=580&top_left_x=1265)
(b) Cannizzaro reaction :
\[
\underset{\text { Formaldehyde }}{\mathrm{HCHO}} \xrightarrow{50 \% \mathrm{NaOH}} \underset{\text { Sodium formate }}{\mathrm{HCOO}^{-}} \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\underset{\text { Methanol }}{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}}

From the above examples, it is evident that \(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}\) bond formation does not take place in the Cannizzaro reaction.
40. (c) : The ease of dehydration of the given compounds can be explained on the basis of the stability of the carbocation formed. In case of options (a), (b) and (d), a secondary carbocation is formed but the presence of an electron withdrawing \(\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}\) group adjacent to the positively charged carbon, intensifies the charge and hence, destabilises the species.

(a)
<smiles>CCC[PH2+]C(C)=O</smiles>

(b)
<smiles>CCC[Si]C(C)=O</smiles>

(d)

However, in case of option (c), a secondary carbocation is formed, but the electron withdrawing \(\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}\) group is present farther away, as a result, the effect of this group is diminished and hence, the carbocation is relatively more stable.

<smiles>CC([O-])O</smiles>
<smiles>CC(=O)[Se]</smiles>
positive iodoform hence, (i), (ii) and (iii) will give positive iodoform not (iv).
42. (c) : The first step is a simple condensation reaction. The last step is an example of E 1 cB mechanism and the leaving group is hydroxide, which is unusual. Still this step manages to take place owing to the stability incorporated therein the product, which is a conjugated carbonyl compound.

43. (a) : The base \(\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)\)ion removes one of the \(\alpha\)-hydrogen atom (which is some what acidic) from aldehydes and ketones to form a carbanion or the enolate ion. The acidity of \(\alpha\)-hydrogen is due to resonance stabilization of enolate anion. 44. (d) : Aldehydes and ketones are converted to alkanes when treated with zinc amalgam and conc. HCl . This is known as Clemmensen reduction. Here \(\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}\) group is reduced to \(\mathrm{CH}_{2}\) group.

45. (a) : Aldehydes which do not have \(\alpha-\mathrm{H}\) atom, in presence of \(50 \% \mathrm{NaOH}\) or \(50 \% \mathrm{KOH}\) undergo disproportionation reaction to produce alcohol and sodium salt of acid. This reaction is known as Cannizzaro reaction. \(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CHO}\) containing no \(\alpha-\mathrm{H}\) atom undergoes Cannizzaro reaction to produce benzyl alcohol and sodium benzoate.

54. (c) : Tollens' reagent is a solution of ammoniacal silver nitrate and used for the detection of -CHO group. An aldehyde reduces Tollens' reagent and itself gets oxidised to convert \(\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\)ions to Ag powder which forms the silver coloured mirror in the test tube. So, this test is also known as silver mirror test.

14. (a) : Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts' reaction due to salt formation with aluminium chloride which is used as a Lewis acid.
Aromatic amines cannot be prepared by Gabriel phthalimide synthesis because aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with the anion formed by phthalimide.
15. (b)
16. (c) : Primary aliphatic amines react with nitrous acid to form aliphatic diazonium salts which are unstable while aromatic amines react with nitrous acid at low temperature ( \(273-278 \mathrm{~K}\) ) to form diazonium salts, a very important class of compounds used for synthesis of a variety of aromatic compounds.
17. (d) : Benzene sulphonyl chloride \(\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{SO}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}\right)\), which is also known as Hinsberg's reagent, reacts with primary amines to form sulphonamides. The hydrogen attached to nitrogen in sulphonamide is strongly acidic due to the presence of strong electron withdrawing sulphonyl group. Hence, it is soluble in alkali.

18. (a) : Aliphatic and aromatic primary amines give carbylamine test. Secondary and tertiary amines do not show this reaction.
19. (b) : The basicity of amines in aqueous solution depends on the stability of the ammonium cation or conjugate acid formed by accepting a proton from water which in turn depends on the \(+I\)-effect of alkyl group, extent of hydrogen bonding and steric factor. All these factors are favourable for \(2^{\circ}\) amines. Therefore, \(2^{\circ}\) amines are the strongest bases. If the alkyl group is small i.e., \(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) then there is no steric hindrance to H -bonding. Thus, the stability due to hydrogen bonding predominates over the stability due to \(+I\)-effect of \(-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\) group and hence primary amine is a stronger base than \(3^{\circ}\) amine. Hence, overall decreasing basic strength for methylamines in aqueous solution is
\(\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2} \mathrm{NH}>\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{NH}_{2}>\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{~N}\)
20. (a) : Secondary amines on reaction with Hinsberg's reagent give \(N, N\)-dialkylbenzene sulphonamide which does not contain any hydrogen atom attached to N -atom, it is not acidic and hence, insoluble in alkali. Tertiary amines do not react with Hinsberg's reagent. Primary amines give products which are soluble in alkali.

The reason for formation of an unexpected amount of \(m\)-nitroaniline is that under strongly acidic condition of nitration, most of the aniline is converted into anilinium ion and since, \(-\stackrel{+}{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{H}_{3}\) is a \(m\)-directing group, therefore, a large amount of \(m\)-nitroaniline is also obtained.
22. (c) : \(+I\) effect of substituted group increases the basic strength while \(-I\) effect of substitutent decreases the basic strength of aniline.
23. (c) : In arylamines, lone pair of electrons on nitrogen atom is delocalised over the benzene ring, thus, not available for donation. So, arylamines are less basic than alkylamines.

26. (a) : As \(A\) gives alcohol on treatment with nitrous acid thus, it should be primary amine. \(\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{9} \mathrm{~N}\) has two possible structures with \(-\mathrm{NH}_{2}\) group.

Lone pair of electrons are more delocalised in diphenylamine and triphenylamine, thus these are less basic than aniline. In benzylamine, the electron pair present on nitrogen is not delocalised with the benzene ring hence, it is more basic than aniline.

As, \(\mathrm{NO}_{2}{ }^{+}\)electrophile can attack both ortho and para positions, therefore both (a) and (c) products will be obtained.

Primary amine Nitrous acid Alcohol
37. (b) : Basic strength decreases as, cyclohexylamine > aniline > benzamide.
Lesser basicity in aniline and benzamide is due to participation of lone pair of electrons of \(-\mathrm{NH}_{2}\) group in resonance.
38. (a) : In carbylamine reaction, primary amines on heating with chloroform in presence of alcoholic KOH form isocyanides (or carbylamines). It is used to distinguish \(1^{\circ}\) amines from \(2^{\circ}\) and \(3^{\circ}\) amines.

\section*{Hints \& Explanations}
1. (c) : Despite having the aldehyde group, glucose does not react with Schiff's reagent and does not form the hydrogen sulphate addition product with \(\mathrm{NaHSO}_{3}\).
2. (c) : In sucrose, two monosaccharides are held together by a glycosidic linkage between \(\mathrm{C}-1\) of \(\alpha-D\)-glucose and \(\mathrm{C}-2\) of \(\beta\)-D-fructose.
\[
\text { Sucrose } \xrightarrow{\text { Hydrolysis }} \alpha-D \text {-glucose }+\beta-D \text {-fructose }
\]

4. (b) : All monosaccharides whether aldoses or ketoses are reducing sugars. Disaccharides such as sucrose in which the two monosaccharide units are linked through their reducing centres i.e., aldehydic or ketonic groups are non-reducing.
5. (d) :
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/817aef6d-da20-4102-a276-e09829360902-223.jpg?height=377&width=604&top_left_y=2129&top_left_x=230)
6. (b) : Sucrose is formed by the condensation of \(\alpha\)-D-glucopyranose and \(\beta\)-D-fructofuranose.
7. (c) : (+)-Lactose is a reducing sugar and all reducing sugars show mutarotation.
8. (a) : Sucrose does not show mutarotation.

Mutarotation is the phenomenon of change in optical rotation shown by freshly prepared solutions of sugars. However, this property is not exhibited by all sugars. Only those sugars which have a free aldehyde ( -CHO ) or ketone ( \(>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}\) ) group are capable of showing mutarotation. Sucrose lacks free aldehyde or ketone group and is therefore, incapable of showing mutarotation.
9. (d) : Under alkaline conditions of the reagent, fructose gets converted into a mixture of glucose and mannose (Lobry de Bruyn van Ekenstein rearrangement) both of which contain the - CHO group and hence, reduce Tollens' reagent to give silver mirror test.

This structure of \(\beta\) - \(D\)-glucose has five asymmetric carbon atoms.
11. (c): Glycolysis is the first stage in the oxidation of glucose. It is an anaerobic process and involves the degradation of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate with the generation of two molecules of ATP.
12. (b) : Glucose reduces Fehling solution because glucose has free- CHO group which is readily oxidised.
13. (b) : Glucose forms a stable hemiacetal between the -CHO group and the -OH group on the \(5^{\text {th }}\) carbon. In this process, the \(1^{\text {st }}\) 'C' atom becomes asymmetric giving two isomers which differ in the configuration of the asymmetric carbon. These two isomers are called as anomers.

14. (a) : Fructose is the sweetest among all the sugars and is highly soluble in water.
15. (d) : Glucose first reacts with phenyl hydrazine giving phenylhydrazone. Then the adjacent -CHOH group is oxidized by a \(2^{\text {nd }}\) phenyl hydrazine molecule and itself is reduced to aniline. The resulting carbonyl group reacts with \(3^{\text {rd }}\) phenyl hydrazine molecule giving osazone.

28. (b): \(\alpha\)-Helix structure is formed when the chain of \(\alpha\)-amino acids coil as a right handed screw because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between amide groups of the same peptide chain, i.e., NH group in one unit is linked to carbonyl oxygen of an adjacent turns of the helix by hydrogen bonding. This H -bonding is responsible for holding helix in a stable position.

Acetaldehyde does not give Victor Meyer test.
4. (b) : Acetaldehyde, acetone and methyl ketones having \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CO}\) - group undergo haloform reaction. Thus, \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CHO}\) will give yellow precipitate with \(\mathrm{I}_{2}\) and NaOH but \(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CHO}\) will not.

6. (c) : Tollens' reagent is a solution of ammoniacal silver nitrate and used for the detection of -CHO group. Aldehydes reduce Tollens' reagent and itself gets oxidised to convert \(\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\) ions to Ag powder which forms the silver coloured mirror in the test tube. So, this test is also known as silver mirror test.
\(R-\mathrm{CHO}+\left[\mathrm{Ag}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{2}\right]^{+} \rightarrow R-\mathrm{COO}^{-}+\mathrm{Ag}\)

10. (c) : MgO is the oxide of weak base and we know that heat of neutralisation of 1 eq. of strong acid with strong base is \(-57.33 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}\).
⇒ With weak base some heat is absorbed in dissociation of weak base.
⇒ Heat of neutralisation of weak base with strong acid will be less than \(-57.33 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}\).
