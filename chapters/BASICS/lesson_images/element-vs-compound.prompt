Element vs compound: same idea (pure substance), different building blocks.

Two equal vertical panels on a dark background.

LEFT PANEL (ELEMENT):
Top: a small piece of copper metal (reddish-brown), looks like a solid chunk/wire.
Bottom: circular magnification bubble showing many identical spheres (all same color/size), packed together. No different types.

RIGHT PANEL (COMPOUND):
Top: a clear glass of water.
Bottom: circular magnification bubble showing repeated groups of 3 spheres (two small + one larger) bonded together, many identical groups.

ONLY THESE LABELS (under panels):
- "Element"
- "Compound"

NO other text. No formulas/symbols. Keep it clean and high-contrast.
