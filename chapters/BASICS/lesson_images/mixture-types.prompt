Two mixtures: homogeneous vs heterogeneous.

LEFT:
A clear glass beaker of water with salt dissolved (looks completely uniform and transparent). A small salt shaker beside it.

RIGHT:
A clear glass beaker with oil and water forming two visible layers (oil on top). A small oil bottle beside it.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "Homogeneous" (under left beaker)
- "Heterogeneous" (under right beaker)

NO other text. Keep it clean and high-contrast.
