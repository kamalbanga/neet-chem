Same substance, three states: the difference is particle arrangement.

Three equal vertical panels on a dark background.

PANEL 1 (SOLID):
Top: an ice cube on a small plate, sharp edges, holds shape.
Bottom: a circular magnification bubble showing particles packed very close in an orderly array. Tiny short vibration arrows on a few particles.

PANEL 2 (LIQUID):
Top: water in a clear glass, flat surface, takes the glass shape.
Bottom: circular bubble showing particles close together but disordered, with small sideways arrows showing sliding past each other.

PANEL 3 (GAS):
Top: steam/mist spreading out into open space (e.g., from a kettle), clearly expanding to fill space.
Bottom: circular bubble showing particles far apart with longer arrows in random directions.

ONLY THESE LABELS (centered under each panel):
- "Solid"
- "Liquid"
- "Gas"

NO other text. No equations. Keep it clean and high-contrast.
