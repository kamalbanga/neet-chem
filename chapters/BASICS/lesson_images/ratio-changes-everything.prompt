Two identical-looking clear liquids — one you drink, the other strips hair color. The difference? One extra oxygen atom.

LEFT HALF:
A clear glass of water. Calm, ordinary. A few condensation drops on the glass.
Small circular magnification bubble near the bottom: simple molecule with 2 small spheres bonded to 1 larger sphere (H₂O).

RIGHT HALF:
A strand of dark black hair dipped halfway into a bowl of the same clear liquid. The submerged part is turning pale blonde — color visibly stripping away. Dramatic contrast between the dark dry hair and the bleached wet portion.
Small circular magnification bubble near the bottom: molecule with 2 small spheres bonded to 2 larger spheres in a chain (H₂O₂).

Between the two magnification bubbles, a small annotation: "+1 oxygen atom"

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "H₂O" (under left bubble)
- "H₂O₂" (under right bubble)

NO title. NO other text. The visual contrast tells the story.
