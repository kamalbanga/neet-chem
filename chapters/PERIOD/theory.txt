[PERIOD_T_001] Big Picture of Periodicity

Three elements: lithium, sodium, potassium. All soft enough to cut with a knife. Drop any one in water — it reacts violently.

Why do these three behave like family?

@continue

group-pattern.chem.svg

@continue

Count the outermost electrons. Li has one. Na has one. K has one. Different sizes — two shells, three, four — but always that single outer electron.

It's the outer electrons that react. Same outer count, same chemistry.

@continue

Three more: fluorine, chlorine, bromine. All aggressively grab electrons from anything nearby. Outer electron count? Seven, seven, seven.

This repeating pattern is what **periodic law** states: properties of elements repeat when elements are arranged by increasing atomic number. The whole system built on this pattern is **periodic classification**.

@continue

Now a surprise. Fluorine has three times more protons than lithium. You'd expect a bigger atom. It's actually less than half lithium's size.

Both sit in the same row — their outer electrons fill the same shell. But fluorine has 9 protons pulling that shell inward; lithium has only 3. More pull, same shell — the atom shrinks.

@continue

Down a column, the opposite. Li to Na to K — each step adds a new shell. The outer electron sits farther out, shielded by more inner layers. The atom grows.

Shrink across, expand down. Every trend in this chapter — how easily atoms lose electrons, how eagerly they grab extras, how strongly they pull on shared pairs — traces back to this tug-of-war between nuclear charge and distance.


[PERIOD_T_002] Early Attempts at Classification

Lithium: atomic weight 7. Potassium: atomic weight 39. Average those two — (7 + 39) ÷ 2 = 23.

Sodium's atomic weight? Exactly 23. The middle element's weight is the average of the two extremes.

@continue

Johann Dobereiner spotted this pattern in the early 1800s. He called these sets of three `Dobereiner's Triads`. The **Law of Triads** worked for several groups: Ca–Sr–Ba, Cl–Br–I.

But most elements didn't fit into neat trios. The pattern was real but too narrow.

@continue

John Newlands tried something broader. Line up all known elements by increasing atomic weight, and every eighth element shows similar properties — like musical notes repeating every octave. He called this the **Law of Octaves**.

It worked up to calcium. After that, the pattern collapsed. Newlands had assumed every row has the same length. They don't — later rows hold 18 or even 32 elements, not 8.

@continue

Both attempts caught a real pattern. Neither could handle the full set of elements. A more flexible system was needed.


[PERIOD_T_003] Mendeleev's Periodic Table

In 1871, Mendeleev predicted an undiscovered element below aluminium. Its density should be about 5.9 g/cm³, he said.

Gallium was discovered four years later. Density: 5.94. Almost exact.

@continue

He made another prediction — an element below silicon, which he called **Eka-silicon**. Germanium, discovered in 1886, matched his predictions perfectly.

How could he predict properties of elements nobody had found?

@continue

Mendeleev and **Lothar Meyer** independently discovered: arrange elements by increasing atomic weight, and similar properties repeat at regular intervals. **Mendeleev's Periodic Law** states this — properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic weights.

@continue

He laid elements in rows and columns so that similar ones fell in the same column. Where the pattern demanded an element but none was known, he left a gap — and used the surrounding elements to predict what should fill it.

The gap below aluminium he called **Eka-aluminium**. The gap below silicon, **Eka-silicon**.

@continue

eka-predictions.chem.svg

@continue

Both predictions came true because the pattern was real.

But the table had a problem. Some elements had to sit out of atomic-weight order to keep their chemistry in the right column.

@continue

Tellurium (atomic weight 128) came before iodine (127) — heavier before lighter. Mendeleev assumed the atomic weights were wrong. They weren't.

The real fix would come from a different property entirely.


[PERIOD_T_004] Modern Periodic Law

Mendeleev sorted elements by atomic weight. But tellurium (128) had to come before iodine (127) — heavier before lighter — just to keep their chemistry in the right columns.

Isotopes made it worse. Chlorine exists as Cl-35 and Cl-37 — same element, different masses. If atomic weight defines position, which mass do you pick?

@continue

The answer: stop sorting by mass entirely.

**Henry Moseley** found this in 1913. He measured the characteristic X-rays each element emits and plotted √ν against the number of protons in the nucleus — the **atomic number**.

@continue

moseley-plot.chem.svg

@continue

Every element fell on a clean straight line. Plot √ν against atomic weight instead — the points scatter, and some even swap order (argon and potassium cross over). Atomic number gives the clean pattern.

The **Modern Periodic Law**: physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.

@continue

Tellurium (Z = 52) now naturally sits before iodine (Z = 53). No exceptions needed.

Why does atomic number work where weight failed? Because atomic number fixes the electron count. And it's the electrons — specifically the outer ones — that decide chemistry.


[PERIOD_T_005] Structure of the Modern Periodic Table

Period 1 has 2 elements. Period 2 has 8. Period 3 has 8. Period 4 jumps to 18. Period 5 also has 18. Period 6 stretches to 32.

Why 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32 — and not some regular number?

@continue

Each period fills one more set of subshells. Period 1 fills only 1s — room for 2 electrons, so 2 elements. Periods 2 and 3 fill s and p orbitals (8 each).

Periods 4 and 5 add d orbitals (18 each). Period 6 adds f orbitals too (32 elements).

@continue

period-subshells.chem.svg

@continue

The rule: number of elements in a period = twice the number of orbitals filled in that period. The period lengths aren't arbitrary — they're set by quantum mechanics.

The 7 horizontal rows are called **periods**. The 18 vertical columns are called **groups**. IUPAC numbers groups 1 through 18, left to right.

@continue

The **principal quantum number** of the outermost shell equals the period number. All Period 3 elements have n = 3 as their highest shell.

The 14 elements filling 4f orbitals (Ce to Lu) and the 14 filling 5f (Th to Lr) are pulled out below the main table to keep it compact.

@continue

IUPAC gives unnamed elements temporary names from digit roots: 0 = nil, 1 = un, 2 = bi, 3 = tri, 4 = quad, ending in "-ium."

Element 104 = un-nil-quad-ium = Unnilquadium. Once confirmed, a permanent name replaces it — 104 is now Rutherfordium. This is the **IUPAC nomenclature** system.


[PERIOD_T_006] Electronic Configuration and the Periodic Table

Sodium's **electronic configuration** is [Ne] 3s¹. That single line tells you exactly where Na sits in the periodic table.

The "3" in 3s¹ is the highest principal quantum number — Period 3. The "s¹" means one **valence shell** electron — Group 1.

@continue

Try chlorine: [Ne] 3s² 3p⁵. Highest n is still 3 — Period 3. It's in the p-block, so group = 12 + number of p electrons = 12 + 5 = Group 17.

The table *is* the configuration, laid out as a grid. Every element in Group 1 ends in s¹. Every element in Group 17 ends in s² p⁵. Same group, same valence pattern — that's why they behave alike.

@continue

The **aufbau principle** governs filling order: electrons enter the lowest available orbital first. Each time a new shell starts filling, a new period begins.

@continue

Now a trickier one — iron: [Ar] 3d⁶ 4s². Highest n is 4 — Period 4. But the last electrons entered the 3d subshell. That puts iron in the d-block.

Its group? For d-block, add d and s electrons: 6 + 2 = 8. Group 8.

@continue

config-decoder.chem.svg

@continue

Three blocks, three group-number rules. s-block: group = valence electrons. d-block: group = d + s electrons. p-block: group = 12 + p electrons.

Configuration tells you the period (highest n), the block (which subshell fills last), and the group.


[PERIOD_T_007] s-Block and p-Block Elements

Why do all Group 1 elements — lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, francium — behave the same way? Soft metals, violent reactions with water, always forming +1 ions.

Check their configurations. Every one ends in ns¹. One loosely held outer electron. That single electron is easy to lose — and losing it is exactly what they all do.

Same valence configuration, same chemistry.

@continue

pt-blocks.chem.svg

@continue

Where the last electron enters — s, p, d, or f — defines the block. Groups 1 and 2 form the **s-block**: last electron enters an s orbital.

Group 1 elements are the **alkali metals** (ns¹). Group 2 — Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra — are the **alkaline earth metals** (ns²). They lose one or two electrons to form +1 or +2 ions.

Their compounds are mostly ionic (except Li and Be, which show more covalent character).

@continue

Hydrogen is the oddball. It has ns¹ like alkali metals, but it's a nonmetal. It can also *gain* an electron like halogens. So it sits alone at the top — not firmly in any group.

Helium (1s²) is technically s-block by filling order, but its valence shell is full. It behaves like a noble gas, so it's placed with Group 18.

@continue

Groups 13 to 18 form the **p-block** — last electron enters a p orbital. This block holds enormous variety: metals, nonmetals, and metalloids all live here.

The pattern holds: same group, same outer configuration, same chemistry. Every Group 17 element ends in ns² np⁵ — one electron short of a full shell. That's why they all aggressively grab electrons. These are the **halogens** — "salt producers."

@continue

Group 16 (O, S, Se, Te) are the `chalcogens` — "ore formers." Two electrons short of a full shell.

Group 18 (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) are the **noble gases** — full outer shells, near-zero reactivity.

s-block and p-block together are called `representative elements` (or main group elements). Their valence electron count follows a predictable pattern from the group number.


[PERIOD_T_008] d-Block and f-Block Elements

Iron rusts. Copper turns green. Gold stays untarnished. All three are metals — but they behave very differently from sodium or calcium.

Sodium has one option: lose its lone outer electron. Na⁺, always. But iron can be Fe²⁺ *or* Fe³⁺. Manganese ranges from +2 all the way to +7. Where does this flexibility come from?

@continue

These elements sit in the middle of the table, Groups 3 to 12. They're the **d-block** elements, with general outer configuration (n−1)d¹⁻¹⁰ ns⁰⁻².

The key is energy spacing. In sodium, there's a big energy gap between the outer 3s electron and the 2p core below. Only one electron can participate.

But in iron, 3d and 4s electrons are nearly equal in energy. Remove two (4s electrons) — Fe²⁺. Remove three — Fe³⁺. The close spacing gives transition metals their variable oxidation states.

@continue

Most d-block elements are called **transition elements**. The distinction matters: a transition element must have a partially filled d subshell in the element or its common ions.

@continue

d-transition-test.chem.svg

@continue

Partly filled d orbitals also explain coloured ions. When light hits Cu²⁺ in solution, it has just the right energy to bump a d electron from one orbital to another. The light absorbed is in the visible range — and the colour you see is whatever's left over. Cu²⁺ absorbs red/orange, so the solution looks blue.

Fully filled or completely empty d orbitals can't do this — no electron jump is possible within the subshell.

@continue

Many transition metals work as catalysts too. Their variable oxidation states let them shuttle electrons between reactants — accepting from one, donating to another.

@continue

Zn, Cd, and Hg sit in the d-block but break every rule. d¹⁰ configurations — all d orbitals full. No variable valence, no colour, no typical transition behaviour.

@continue

Below the main table sit two rows of 14 elements each. These are the **f-block** elements — last electron enters an f orbital.

The first row (Ce to Lu, Z = 58–71) fills 4f orbitals. These are the **lanthanoids**.

@continue

Their chemistry is remarkable for its *sameness*. Almost all show the +3 oxidation state. Why so uniform?

The 4f orbitals sit deep inside the atom — buried beneath the 5s, 5p, and 5d shells. They're too far from the bonding zone to affect chemistry.

It's as if the 4f electrons are locked in a back room while the outer electrons do all the work.

@continue

The second row (Th to Lr, Z = 90–103) fills 5f orbitals. These are the **actinoids**. All are radioactive. Elements beyond uranium (Z > 92) are called **transuranium elements** — most are synthetic.

Lanthanoids and actinoids together are called **inner-transition elements**.


[PERIOD_T_009] Metals, Non-metals, and Metalloids

Iron is hammered into sheets. Copper is drawn into wires. Both conduct electricity. These are typical **metals** — they lose electrons easily, form cations.

They make up over 78% of all known elements.

@continue

Most metals are solid, but mercury is liquid at room temperature. Gallium and caesium melt just above room temperature (~302–303 K) — you could melt them in your hand.

@continue

**Non-metals** are the opposite. Sulfur is brittle. Oxygen is a gas. Neither conducts electricity well.

Non-metals tend to *gain* electrons and form anions. They cluster at the top-right of the periodic table.

@continue

Between them runs a zig-zag staircase line — from boron down through silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium.

@continue

staircase.chem.svg

@continue

Elements along this boundary share properties of *both* sides.

Silicon looks metallic but conducts electricity poorly — unless you dope it with impurities. These borderline elements are **metalloids** (also called **semi-metals**).

@continue

The trend across a period is clear. Start at sodium (far left) — a highly reactive metal. Move right through magnesium, aluminium... metallic character fades.

By silicon you're at the boundary. Continue to chlorine and argon — fully non-metallic.

@continue

Down a group, metallic character *increases*. Carbon is a nonmetal. Silicon is a metalloid. Tin and lead are metals.

More shells mean the outer electrons are farther from the nucleus — easier to lose.

So metallic character increases down a group and decreases across a period. Non-metallic character follows the reverse.


[PERIOD_T_010] Effective Nuclear Charge and Shielding

Lithium has 3 protons. But its outer electron doesn't feel +3. Two inner electrons sit between it and the nucleus, pushing outward, partially cancelling the pull.

The outer electron feels roughly +1. That net pull is the `effective nuclear charge` (Zeff) — nuclear charge minus the cancelling effect of inner electrons.

@continue

Those inner electrons act as a shield. **Shielding** (also called **screening**) is why outer electrons are so much easier to remove than inner ones. More inner shells, stronger shield.

Now the critical question: what changes across a period?

@continue

Go from Li to Be. Same inner shell — two 1s electrons. But Be has 4 protons, not 3. Same shield, stronger pull. Zeff rises.

Continue to B, C, N, O, F. Each step adds one proton and one electron.

But the new electron enters the same outer shell — it sits *beside* the existing outer electrons, not *between* them and the nucleus.

@continue

That's the key. Same-shell electrons shield each other poorly. They're at roughly equal distance from the nucleus. Neither blocks the other's line to the positive charge.

@continue

zeff-shielding.chem.svg

@continue

So protons accumulate, shielding barely grows, and **effective nuclear charge** climbs steadily left to right. That's the engine behind every "across a period" trend — shrinking atoms, rising ionization enthalpy, increasing electronegativity.

@continue

Down a group, the reverse. Na has 10 inner electrons shielding. K has 18. Each new period inserts a whole shell between the outer electron and the nucleus.

Shielding grows faster than nuclear charge. Outer electrons feel a weaker Zeff.

Two directions, opposite effects. Across: Zeff rises. Down: Zeff falls. Every trend in this chapter traces back to this pattern.


[PERIOD_T_011] Atomic Radius

Lithium has 3 electrons. Fluorine has 9. Both sit in Period 2 — their outermost electrons fill the same shell.

More electrons usually means a bigger cloud. So which atom is bigger?

@continue

Walk across Period 2 and watch.

Li: 152 pm. Be: 111 pm. Already shrinking — even though Be has *more* electrons. B: 88 pm. C: 77 pm. N: 74 pm. O: 66 pm. F: 64 pm.

Every step adds one proton and one electron to the same shell. Yet the atom shrinks every time. Fluorine — with six more electrons than lithium — is less than half its size.

@continue

atomic-radius-trend.chem.svg

@continue

The electrons didn't expand the cloud. The protons won.

Each new electron enters the same outer shell — it sits *beside* existing outer electrons, not between them and the nucleus. It barely adds any shielding. But each new proton adds full pull. Zeff climbs, the shell is squeezed inward.

@continue

Down a group, the opposite. Li: 152 pm. Na: 186 pm. K: 231 pm. Each step adds a whole new shell.

The outer electron sits farther from the nucleus, shielded by an entire new layer of inner electrons. The atom *grows*.

@continue

How is **atomic radius** actually measured? You can't measure a single atom's edge — the electron cloud has no sharp boundary.

For nonmetals, we measure the distance between two bonded atoms and halve it. Cl₂ has a bond length of 198 pm, so chlorine's `covalent radius` is 99 pm.

@continue

For metals, we halve the distance between adjacent atoms in a crystal. Copper atoms sit 256 pm apart, giving a `metallic radius` of 128 pm.

Noble gases don't bond with themselves under normal conditions. Their radii are estimated from how close two unbound atoms sit near each other — the `van der Waals radius`. These are much larger than covalent radii.

@continue

One surprise: gallium (Group 13, Period 4) is *smaller* than aluminium above it. Going down a group should make atoms bigger. What went wrong?

The 3d electrons that fill before gallium sit in spread-out orbitals. They don't effectively block the nuclear charge from reaching the outer electrons. So Ga's outer electrons get pulled in tighter than expected.


[PERIOD_T_012] Ionic Radius

Sodium has three electron shells: [2, 8, 1]. Remove that one outer electron to make Na⁺, and you're left with [2, 8] — the entire third shell is gone.

That's why the **ionic radius** drops from 186 pm to 95 pm. You haven't just squeezed the same cloud tighter. You've stripped away a whole shell. What remains is the compact neon core.

@continue

This is what happens with most metal **cations**. K⁺ loses its 4th shell. Mg²⁺ loses all of shell 3. Each time, the ion shrinks down to the noble gas core underneath.

Cations are always *smaller* than their parent atoms. And the more electrons removed, the greater the shrinkage.

@continue

Mg²⁺ is even smaller than Na⁺ — it lost the same shell and has one more proton pulling the remaining electrons inward.

@continue

**Anions** work the opposite way. Fluorine has 9 protons and 9 electrons. Add one to make F⁻: still 9 protons, now 10 electrons.

The extra electron doesn't add a new shell. It joins the existing outer shell. But with 10 electrons sharing the pull of only 9 protons, each one feels weaker Zeff.

The cloud loosens — F⁻ balloons from 64 pm to 136 pm.

@continue

ionic-radius.chem.svg

@continue

Anions are always *larger* than their parent atoms.

Ionic radii follow the same periodic trends as atomic radii. Across a period, cations shrink (rising nuclear charge on similar cores).

Down a group, both cations and anions grow — more shells mean more distance.


[PERIOD_T_013] Isoelectronic Species

O²⁻ has 10 electrons. F⁻ has 10 electrons. Na⁺ has 10. Mg²⁺ has 10. Four different species, four different elements — but the same electron count.

Species with the same number of electrons are called **isoelectronic species**.

@continue

Same electrons, but their sizes are very different. O²⁻ is the largest. Mg²⁺ is the smallest. Why?

O²⁻ has only 8 protons holding those 10 electrons. F⁻ has 9. Na⁺ has 11. Mg²⁺ has 12. More protons pulling on the same number of electrons means a tighter, smaller cloud.

@continue

The rule is simple: among isoelectronic species, the one with the *most* protons (highest nuclear charge) is the smallest.

So the size order is: O²⁻ > F⁻ > Na⁺ > Mg²⁺.

@continue

isoelectronic.chem.svg

@continue

This works for any isoelectronic set. N³⁻, O²⁻, F⁻, Ne, Na⁺, Mg²⁺, Al³⁺ — all have 10 electrons.

Line them up by nuclear charge and the sizes fall into place: most negative ion is largest, most positive ion is smallest.


[PERIOD_T_014] Ionization Enthalpy

Removing an electron from Na costs 496 kJ/mol. From F, it costs 1681 kJ/mol — over three times more. Same period, vastly different grip.

The energy needed to remove the outermost electron from an isolated gaseous atom is its **first ionization enthalpy**:

X(g) → X⁺(g) + e⁻

@continue

The trend should track Zeff. Across a period, Zeff rises, the atom grips tighter. So **ionization enthalpy** should climb steadily left to right — each element harder to ionize than the last.

Let's check. Here's Period 2, one element at a time.

@continue

ie-trend.chem.svg

@continue

Li: 520 kJ/mol. Be: 900. Steep climb — matches the prediction perfectly.

Now boron: 801. It dropped.

Boron has *more* protons than beryllium. It should grip harder. Why is it easier to ionize?

@continue

2s-vs-2p.chem.svg

@continue

Be's outer electron sits in a 2s orbital — it penetrates close to the nucleus. B's outer electron is in 2p — a new subshell, farther out on average, easier to remove.

One extra proton wasn't enough to offset the jump from s to p. The orbital type matters, not just Zeff.

@continue

The climb resumes. C: 1086. N: 1402. Three clean steps up — Zeff winning again.

Oxygen: 1314. Another drop. N has one fewer proton, yet holds its electrons more tightly.

This time both electrons are in 2p. The s-vs-p argument can't apply. Something else is going on.

@continue

Nitrogen's three 2p electrons each occupy a separate orbital — spread out, no crowding.

Oxygen's fourth 2p electron must pair up in one orbital, creating extra electron-electron repulsion. That paired electron is easier to knock off.

@continue

Two dips in a "steady climb" — and each reveals something the simple Zeff picture misses. The Be→B dip shows that orbital type matters. The N→O dip shows that pairing costs energy.

F: 1681. Ne: 2081. The climb finishes at the noble gas peak.

@continue

Down a group, the opposite. Li (520) → Na (496) → K (419). Each step adds a new shell. The outer electron sits farther out, shielded by more inner layers. Easier to remove.

@continue

Now consider removing a *second* electron. After the first is gone, the atom is already a positive ion — its remaining electrons feel a stronger pull. So **second ionization enthalpy** is always higher than first.

Na's IE₁ is 496, IE₂ is 4562 — a ninefold jump. That second electron comes from the stable neon core. Breaching a noble gas shell costs enormous energy.

Every trend in ionization enthalpy traces back to one question: how tightly does the atom grip that outermost electron?


[PERIOD_T_015] Electron Gain Enthalpy

Halogens have seven outer electrons — one short of a full shell. They *want* that extra electron. Among them, fluorine is the smallest, with the highest Zeff. It should grab hardest.

Predict: which halogen releases the most energy when it gains an electron?

@continue

The energy change when an electron is added to a neutral gaseous atom is called **electron gain enthalpy** (ΔegH):

X(g) + e⁻ → X⁻(g)

When energy is released, ΔegH is *negative*. More negative means the atom is more eager to accept an electron.

@continue

Build the halogen series bottom-up. Iodine: −295 kJ/mol. Bromine: −325. Chlorine: −349. Getting more negative as atoms shrink — exactly as Zeff predicts.

Fluorine should break the record.

@continue

ege-halogens.chem.svg

@continue

Fluorine: −328. Less negative than chlorine. The prediction fails.

@continue

Fluorine is *too* small. Its 2p orbitals are so compact that seven electrons are already crammed tightly. When the eighth arrives, it faces fierce repulsion from the existing crowd.

Chlorine's 3p orbitals are larger — more room, less crowding. The incoming electron settles in with less repulsion, so more net energy is released.

Same physics as the N→O ionization dip — cramming electrons into small spaces costs energy.

@continue

The general trend still holds. Across a period, Zeff rises and atoms shrink. An incoming electron lands closer to a stronger nucleus — more energy released. ΔegH becomes more negative left to right.

Down a group, the atom grows. The incoming electron lands farther from the nucleus, in a larger shell. Less attraction, less energy released. ΔegH becomes less negative.

@continue

Noble gases are the exception. Their outer shells are completely full. An extra electron would have to enter the next higher shell — far from the nucleus, barely held. Their electron gain enthalpies are large *positive* numbers.

@continue

An older term, `electron affinity`, uses the opposite sign convention — positive means energy released. NCERT uses electron gain enthalpy.


[PERIOD_T_016] Electronegativity

H₂ is a molecule of two identical atoms. The shared electrons sit perfectly centered. Equal tug-of-war, no winner.

Replace one hydrogen with fluorine. HF. Same deal — two atoms sharing a pair of electrons. But now the sharing is lopsided. The electrons spend far more time near fluorine.

@continue

bond-polarity.chem.svg

@continue

HF has a measurable dipole — one end slightly negative, the other slightly positive. The molecule is lopsided because fluorine pulls the shared pair toward itself.

Replace fluorine with chlorine. HCl also has a dipole — but weaker. HBr, weaker still. HI, barely any.

What decides how hard an atom pulls on shared electrons?

@continue

This pulling power is called **electronegativity**. It's not about gaining or losing electrons outright — it's about tug-of-war over a *shared* pair in a bond.

Linus Pauling built the most widely used scale. He assigned fluorine — the strongest puller — a value of 4.0. Everything else is measured relative to that. This is the **Pauling scale**.

@continue

The logic follows Zeff. Fluorine: small atom, high Zeff. The shared pair sits close to a strong nucleus. Powerful pull. Iodine: large atom, the shared pair sits far from the nucleus. Weak pull.

Across Period 2: Li = 1.0, Be = 1.5, B = 2.0, C = 2.5, N = 3.0, O = 3.5, F = 4.0. A clean staircase — increments of 0.5, tracking the steady rise in Zeff.

Down a group, electronegativity falls. Larger atoms, more shielding, weaker grip on shared pairs.

@continue

Electronegativity connects directly to metallic character. Metals have low electronegativity — they'd rather *lose* electrons than pull shared ones.

Non-metals have high electronegativity — they pull shared electrons toward themselves.

The increase in electronegativity across a period mirrors the shift from metallic to non-metallic behaviour.

@continue

One important nuance: electronegativity isn't a fixed property of an isolated atom. It depends on what the atom is bonded *to*. Carbon bonded to fluorine acts more electropositive than carbon bonded to hydrogen.

The values on the Pauling scale are averages across many compounds.


[PERIOD_T_017] Valence and Oxidation States

Na forms NaCl. Mg forms MgCl₂. Al forms AlCl₃. Si forms SiCl₄. Each element takes on more chlorine atoms — 1, 2, 3, 4. What decides the number?

**Valence** is the combining capacity of an element — how many bonds it forms or how many atoms of hydrogen it combines with.

@continue

For metals on the left, valence matches outer electron count. Na has 1 outer electron — it loses that electron, bonds with one Cl⁻. Mg has 2, loses both. Al has 3.

But nitrogen has 5 outer electrons and its valence in NH₃ is 3, not 5. Why?

@continue

Because nitrogen doesn't lose 5 electrons. It *shares* 3 of its electrons with three hydrogen atoms, filling its outer shell to 8.

The valence of 3 comes from how many electrons nitrogen needs to reach a full shell — that's 8 minus 5.

@continue

So valence works two ways. Groups 1–4: valence = outer electrons (atoms that give up or share all of them).

Groups 15–17: valence = 8 minus outer electrons (atoms that share just enough to reach 8).

That's why valence rises from Na (1) to Si (4), then falls: P (3), S (2), Cl (1).

@continue

valence-pattern.chem.svg

@continue

Hydride formulas across Period 3 show this: NaH, MgH₂, AlH₃, SiH₄, PH₃, H₂S, HCl.

@continue

**Oxidation state** is a related but more precise idea. It's the charge an atom would carry if every shared electron pair were assigned entirely to the more electronegative partner.

In Na₂O, sodium is +1 and oxygen is −2. In OF₂, fluorine is more electronegative — so each F is −1, and oxygen is forced to +2. Same element, different partner, different oxidation state.

@continue

Nitrogen shows this range dramatically: −3 in NH₃, but +5 in N₂O₅.

Oxide formulas across Period 3 — Na₂O, MgO, Al₂O₃, SiO₂, P₄O₁₀, SO₃, Cl₂O₇ — show the same valence pattern from the other side.

Oxygen count climbs left to right.


[PERIOD_T_018] Anomalous Properties of Second Period Elements

Nitrogen exists as N₂ — held together by a triple bond. Phosphorus can't do this. It forms P₄ instead, with only single bonds. Why can't the heavier element copy nitrogen?

@continue

Second period elements (Li to F) are the odd ones out in their groups.

Everything traces back to one fact: they sit in the n = 2 shell, which is tiny and has only four orbitals.

@continue

Small size means high charge density. Li⁺ packs a +1 charge into a very small radius. It pulls so hard on the electron cloud of any nearby anion that the bond becomes partly covalent.

LiCl behaves differently from NaCl — more covalent, less ionic — because Li⁺ is so much smaller than Na⁺.

Same with Be²⁺ — doubly charged and tiny. BeCl₂ is a covalent molecule. MgCl₂, with the larger Mg²⁺, is ionic. Second period elements form more covalent compounds than their heavier group members.

@continue

Limited orbitals set a hard ceiling. With only one 2s and three 2p orbitals, second period atoms max out at four bonds. Their **maximum covalency** is 4.

Boron in [BF₄]⁻ is at capacity. Aluminium, with empty 3d orbitals available, easily reaches six bonds in [AlF₆]³⁻.

@continue

Small size also enables sideways p orbital overlap. When two small atoms sit close together, their p orbitals overlap side-by-side — not just end-to-end. This is **pπ–pπ bonding**.

That's how nitrogen forms N≡N. Two small atoms, close enough for strong sideways overlap, make one σ and two π bonds. Carbon does C=C. Oxygen does C=O.

@continue

Phosphorus atoms are too large. Their 3p orbitals are too diffuse for effective sideways overlap. So phosphorus settles for single bonds — four of them, arranged as P₄.

These differences produce a diagonal pattern. Lithium resembles magnesium more than sodium. Beryllium resembles aluminium more than magnesium.

This is the **diagonal relationship** — the first member of a group behaves like the element one group right and one period down.

Li⁺ is small with +1 charge. Mg²⁺ is larger but carries +2. Their charge-to-size ratios end up similar — so they polarize anions to a similar degree, and their chemistry overlaps.

Same logic connects Be²⁺ (tiny, +2) with Al³⁺ (larger, +3).


[PERIOD_T_019] Nature of Oxides

Na₂O dissolves in water and turns litmus blue — it's a base. Cl₂O₇ dissolves in water and turns litmus red — it's an acid.

Both are oxides. The difference? Where the element sits in the period.

@continue

Oxides of elements on the far left are **basic oxides**. Na₂O and MgO react with acids.

Na₂O is ionic — it contains free O²⁻ ions. In water, O²⁻ grabs a proton: O²⁻ + H₂O → 2OH⁻. That's why it's basic. Na₂O + H₂O → 2NaOH.

@continue

Move to the far right. Non-metals form **acidic oxides**. SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄. Cl₂O₇ + H₂O → 2HClO₄.

Non-metal oxides are covalent — no O²⁻ to donate. Instead, water reacts with the covalent oxide to form an acid. The bonding type determines the acid-base behaviour.

The further right in the period, the more acidic the oxide.

@continue

In between sit elements like aluminium. Al₂O₃ reacts with *both* acids and bases.

With HCl, it acts as a base. With NaOH, it acts as an acid. Oxides that go both ways are called **amphoteric oxides**.

@continue

A few oxides don't react with acids *or* bases. CO and NO are **neutral oxides** — they show no acidic or basic behaviour.

The full progression across Period 3:

Metals form ionic oxides — basic. Non-metals form covalent oxides — acidic. Borderline elements like Al form amphoteric oxides. The oxide pattern maps directly onto the metal-to-nonmetal shift across the period.


[PERIOD_T_020] Chemical Reactivity and Periodic Trends

Sodium and chlorine are both extremely reactive. Sodium explodes in water. Chlorine attacks metals on contact.

Put them together: NaCl. Table salt. Completely harmless. Two violent elements making the most boring compound imaginable.

Why are elements at the *edges* of a period so reactive, while those in the middle are calm?

@continue

The two extremes use opposite strategies to reach the same goal — a stable, filled outer shell.

Sodium (far left) has one lonely electron in its outer shell. Losing it is easy — IE₁ is just 496 kJ/mol. Na → Na⁺ + e⁻ happens eagerly. The **metallic character** of an element tracks how easily it loses electrons.

@continue

Chlorine (far right) is one electron *short* of a full shell. Grabbing that electron releases 349 kJ/mol. Cl + e⁻ → Cl⁻. The **non-metallic character** of an element tracks how eagerly it gains electrons.

Both are desperate — one to give, one to take. When they meet, the transfer is instant. Na loses, Cl gains, NaCl forms.

@continue

@continue

In the middle — aluminium, silicon — elements are neither strong losers nor strong gainers. No desperation, no violence.

**Chemical reactivity** peaks at both extremes and dips in the center.

@continue

Down a group, each strategy intensifies on its own side. Cs is more reactive than Na — its outer electron sits farther out, shielded by more layers, easier to lose. Metallic character increases down a group.

Fluorine is more reactive than iodine — its small size and high Zeff make it a fiercer electron-grabber. Non-metallic character increases *up* a group.

@continue

Every trend in this chapter connects to one root: how tightly does the atom hold its outermost electrons?

Zeff controls the grip. Grip controls size, ionization enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy, and electronegativity. And all of those control reactivity. One cause, many effects.
