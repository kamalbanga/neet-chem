Interstitial compounds — small atoms filling gaps in a metal crystal lattice.

LAYOUT: Cross-section view of a metallic crystal lattice.

METAL FRAMEWORK:
Large silver-grey spheres arranged in a regular grid pattern (face-centered or body-centered). These are the transition metal atoms — they form the rigid structural backbone. Show at least 3×3 layers so the repeating pattern is clear.

INTERSTITIAL SITES:
Between the large metal spheres, there are visible GAPS — spaces where the spheres don't touch.
- Some gaps filled with SMALL bright cyan spheres (representing C or N atoms)
- Other gaps left EMPTY — clearly visible as dark holes in the lattice
- The contrast between filled and empty gaps shows non-stoichiometric nature (not every gap is occupied)

CRITICAL SIZE COMPARISON:
- Metal atoms: LARGE spheres (the framework)
- Interstitial atoms: MUCH SMALLER spheres (roughly 1/3 the diameter)
- This shows WHY only small atoms (H, C, N) can fit — bigger atoms simply don't fit through the gaps

VISUAL DETAILS:
- Semi-transparent metal spheres so you can see the interstitial atoms nestled between them
- Subtle metallic sheen on the large spheres
- Bright colour on the small interstitial atoms to make them pop

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "Metal atoms" (arrow pointing to a large sphere)
- "C or N atoms" (arrow pointing to a small interstitial sphere)
- "Empty site" (arrow pointing to an unfilled gap)
