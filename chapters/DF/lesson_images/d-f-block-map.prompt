Simplified periodic table showing block positions. NOT a full periodic table — just block outlines.

LAYOUT — schematic grid of the periodic table:

LEFT (2 columns): s-block, muted steel blue. Label: "s-block"
CENTER (10 columns, 4 rows): d-block, warm amber/gold. Label: "d-block"
RIGHT (6 columns): p-block, muted sage green. Label: "p-block"
BELOW (detached, 14 columns, 2 rows): f-block, muted violet. Label: "f-block"

Within d-block, the FIRST ROW is brighter/highlighted. Small label on it: "3d series (Sc → Zn)"

Within f-block, label top row "Lanthanoids" and bottom row "Actinoids"

Clean, minimal, flat colour blocks. NO element symbols. NO atomic numbers. Just the block outlines showing relative positions and sizes.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "s-block"
- "d-block"
- "p-block"
- "f-block"
- "3d series (Sc → Zn)"
- "Lanthanoids"
- "Actinoids"

NO other text.
