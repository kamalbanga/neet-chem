4:3

The atom is mostly empty space — a scale comparison.

LEFT (~40%): A cricket ball on a cricket pitch, labeled "Nucleus".

RIGHT (~60%): A wide aerial/satellite view of the same cricket ground, showing the boundary fence ~5 km away. A tiny glowing dot marks the edge, labeled "Electron". The vast empty green space between the ball and the boundary dominates the image.

A dashed arc or line connects the cricket ball to the distant boundary to show the scale relationship.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "Nucleus" (near the cricket ball)
- "Electron" (near the distant dot at the boundary)
- "5 km of empty space" (along the dashed line/arc)

NO other text. Simple, clean. The emptiness IS the lesson.
