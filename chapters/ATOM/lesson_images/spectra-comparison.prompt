Three types of spectra — stacked vertically for comparison.

Three horizontal rectangular strips, same width, stacked with gaps between them:

TOP — CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM:
A smooth unbroken rainbow gradient filling the entire strip. Red on the far left, blending through orange, yellow, green, blue, to violet on the far right. Every color present. No gaps, no breaks. Perfectly smooth.

MIDDLE — EMISSION SPECTRUM:
The entire strip is PURE BLACK. On this black background, exactly 4 sharp bright vertical lines glow at specific positions: one red line, one cyan/blue-green line, one blue line, one violet line. The lines are thin, bright, and crisp. The rest of the strip is completely black — no gradients, no dim colors, just blackness with a few bright lines.

BOTTOM — ABSORPTION SPECTRUM:
An exact copy of the top rainbow gradient — BUT with 4 thin vertical BLACK lines cut through it at the same positions as the emission lines above. The rainbow is continuous and smooth everywhere EXCEPT at these 4 narrow dark gaps. Most of the rainbow is intact.

The emission lines and absorption gaps should align vertically — same positions, opposite appearances (bright on black vs dark on rainbow).

ONLY THESE LABELS (left of each strip):
- "Continuous"
- "Emission"
- "Absorption"

NO other text. NO wavelength numbers. Clean and precise.
