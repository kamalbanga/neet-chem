Thomson's prediction: α-particles should pass through the atom easily.

A large circle represents one gold atom (Thomson's model). Entire circle filled with diffuse warm pinkish-red glow — uniform positive charge everywhere. Tiny blue dots scattered inside (electrons embedded like seeds).

Three α-particles (small bright gold/yellow dots with motion trails) enter from the left. Their paths shown as faint lines: all three pass through with barely any bending. Nearly straight. All exit on the right.

The atom feels soft, hazy, cloud-like. No hard spot anywhere.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "α-particles" (near incoming particles)
- "Uniform positive charge" (inside the glowing sphere)

NO other text. The softness IS the prediction.
