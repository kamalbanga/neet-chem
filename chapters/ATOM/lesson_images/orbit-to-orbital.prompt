Side-by-side comparison of Bohr's model versus the quantum picture.

LEFT (~45%): A small bright nucleus at center with a single electron (glowing dot) on a clean circular orbit (thin glowing ring). Precise and geometric. Label: "Orbit — a fixed path"

RIGHT (~45%): Same nucleus at center, surrounded by a cloud of scattered dots — dense near the center, gradually fading outward. No path visible, just a diffuse roughly spherical cloud. Label: "Orbital — a probability cloud"

Arrow between LEFT and RIGHT suggesting the shift. Dark background, clean and minimal. The contrast between the neat circle and the diffuse cloud IS the lesson. No other text.
