The death spiral of Rutherford's atom — why it can't work.

A bright warm-red nucleus at center. An electron (electric blue glowing dot) on a spiral path that winds inward, getting tighter with each turn. The spiral starts wide (outer orbit) and curls in toward the nucleus.

The spiral path leaves a fading trail — bright blue at the outer start, dimming as it spirals in. Faint wavy lines or photon symbols radiate OUTWARD from the spiral at several points along the path — the electron is bleeding energy as electromagnetic radiation.

The innermost part of the spiral nearly touches the nucleus — the electron is about to crash. A sense of doom: inevitable, accelerating collapse.

The outer region is mostly empty and dark. The spiral dominates the image.

ONLY THIS LABEL:
- "Energy lost as radiation" (near one of the outward wavy lines)

NO other text. The tightening spiral IS the lesson.
