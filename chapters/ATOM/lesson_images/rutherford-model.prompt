Rutherford's conclusion: the atom is mostly nothing.

A vast dark circular space represents the full atom. Faint dotted circle marks the atom's boundary.

At the very center: a TINY but intensely bright warm-red glowing dot — the nucleus. It should look impossibly small compared to the atom. All the positive charge and almost all the mass packed into this speck.

Far from the center, near the atom's edge: two or three small electric-blue glowing dots — electrons. Faint dashed circular rings suggest their orbital paths around the nucleus.

The overwhelming visual impression is EMPTINESS. The nucleus is a pinpoint. The electrons are pinpoints. Between them: vast dark nothing.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "Nucleus" (near the tiny bright center — add "(+)" to show positive)
- "Electron" (near one of the blue dots — add "(−)" to show negative)

NO other text. NO scale numbers. The emptiness tells the story.
