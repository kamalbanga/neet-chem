Bohr's quantum jump — the electron teleports, it doesn't travel.

A nucleus (warm red glow) at center. Three concentric circular orbits around it (thin rings, labeled n=1, n=2, n=3 from inside out).

An electron (electric blue glowing dot) is shown MID-JUMP from the n=3 orbit down to the n=2 orbit. No path between them — the electron simply vanishes from one and appears on the other. Show this with a faded ghost on n=3 (where it WAS) and a bright solid dot on n=2 (where it IS NOW).

A photon (small bright golden wavy arrow) shoots outward from the jump point, carrying away the energy difference.

The orbits are clean, stable, circular — NO spiral. This is the anti-spiral. The rings are steady. The electron lives on them without losing energy.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "n = 1", "n = 2", "n = 3" (near each orbit)
- "Photon emitted" (near the golden wavy arrow)

NO other text. The stable orbits + discrete jump contrast with the death spiral.
