What actually happened — same experiment, completely different atom.

Same framing as the Thomson image. Large circle shows the gold atom's boundary (faint dotted outline only).

INSIDE: Almost entirely empty dark space. At the dead center, a TINY intense bright dot — the nucleus. Very small compared to the atom. Brilliant, concentrated, unmissable.

Three α-particles enter from the left (same gold/yellow dots as Thomson image):
1. TOP PATH: Sails clean through empty space — straight line, zero deflection.
2. MIDDLE PATH: Passes near the nucleus, bends noticeably — deflected at angle.
3. BOTTOM PATH: Heads straight at the nucleus and VIOLENTLY BOUNCES BACK to the left. Dramatic reversal with motion lines / energy burst at closest approach.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "Nucleus" (near the tiny bright center)
- "Empty space" (in the vast dark area)
- "Bounced back!" (near the dramatically reversed particle)

NO other text. The emptiness and the violent bounce contrast starkly with Thomson's soft, full sphere.
