Three unsolved puzzles that Werner's theory left behind — same Co³⁺ metal, but wildly different behaviour. Each panel poses a mystery: colour, magnetism, ligand strength.

LAYOUT: Three panels side by side, each framed as a "puzzle card." Each panel has a versus comparison stacked vertically — two complexes compared, with a question mark between them.

LEFT PANEL — COLOUR PUZZLE:
Top half: a round flask filled with YELLOW-ORANGE colour. Below it, the label "[Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺".
Bottom half: a round flask filled with RED colour. Below it, the label "[Co(NH₃)₅(H₂O)]³⁺".
Between the two, a bold "?" symbol.
CRITICAL: Both flasks must be the same shape and size. The ONLY visible difference is the colour. One ligand changed — the colour shifted dramatically.

CENTER PANEL — MAGNETISM PUZZLE:
Top half: a horizontal bar magnet (red-blue poles). Near it, a small sphere representing [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ being gently PUSHED AWAY from the magnet. A small curved arrow showing repulsion. Below: label "[Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺".
Bottom half: same bar magnet. A small sphere representing [CoF₆]³⁻ being PULLED TOWARD the magnet. A small curved arrow showing attraction. Below: label "[CoF₆]³⁻".
Between the two, a bold "?" symbol.
CRITICAL: Same magnet, same Co³⁺ — opposite magnetic response. The push vs pull must be clearly contrasted through arrow direction and sphere position.

RIGHT PANEL — LIGAND STRENGTH PUZZLE:
Top half: a small neutral NH₃ molecule (no charge symbol). A thick connection line to a central Co sphere, indicating STRONG bond. Below: "NH₃" label and "neutral" in smaller text.
Bottom half: F⁻ shown with a "−" charge symbol. A thin, weaker connection line to a central Co sphere, indicating WEAK bond. Below: "F⁻" label and "charged" in smaller text.
Between the two, a bold "?" symbol.
CRITICAL: The charged ion (F⁻) forms the WEAKER bond, the neutral molecule (NH₃) forms the STRONGER one. Thick vs thin bond line is the key contrast.

VISUAL CONSISTENCY:
- All three "?" symbols should be the same size, prominent, glowing — they are the emotional centre of the image
- Each panel has a subtle frame or card-like border
- Co³⁺ is always the same warm-red sphere
- Clean, flat, diagrammatic — not photorealistic

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "Colour" (top of left panel)
- "[Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺" (left panel, top)
- "[Co(NH₃)₅(H₂O)]³⁺" (left panel, bottom)
- "Magnetism" (top of center panel)
- "[Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺" (center panel, top)
- "[CoF₆]³⁻" (center panel, bottom)
- "Ligand strength" (top of right panel)
- "NH₃" and "neutral" (right panel, top)
- "F⁻" and "charged" (right panel, bottom)
- "?" (one per panel, between the two halves)
