Werner's AgNO₃ experiment: three cobalt-ammonia compounds tested with silver nitrate. Each gives a different amount of white precipitate — revealing how many Cl⁻ ions are free vs trapped inside the coordination sphere.

LAYOUT: Three panels side by side, left to right. Each panel shows one compound being tested. The pattern must be unmistakable: precipitate decreases left to right.

LEFT PANEL — CoCl₃·6NH₃ (all Cl⁻ free):
A beaker or test tube containing a YELLOW solution. Three distinct white clumps of precipitate settled at the bottom — clearly three separate chunks to convey "3 mol AgCl."
Above the solution, a small schematic of the coordination sphere: a central sphere (Co) surrounded by six small blue circles (NH₃). Three green circles (Cl⁻) float OUTSIDE the sphere boundary, unattached and free.
CRITICAL: The three green Cl⁻ must be visually OUTSIDE and separated from the central cluster, drifting in solution.

CENTER PANEL — CoCl₃·5NH₃ (one Cl⁻ trapped):
A beaker or test tube containing a PURPLE solution. Two white clumps of precipitate at the bottom.
Above: a central sphere (Co) surrounded by five blue circles (NH₃) and one green circle (Cl⁻) INSIDE the sphere boundary. Two green circles float OUTSIDE.
CRITICAL: The one green Cl⁻ inside the sphere must be clearly within the boundary, visually "locked in" alongside the NH₃ ligands.

RIGHT PANEL — CoCl₃·4NH₃ (two Cl⁻ trapped):
A beaker or test tube containing a GREEN solution. Only one white clump of precipitate at the bottom.
Above: a central sphere (Co) surrounded by four blue circles (NH₃) and two green circles (Cl⁻) INSIDE the sphere boundary. Only one green circle floats OUTSIDE.

VISUAL CONSISTENCY ACROSS ALL THREE PANELS:
- Co central sphere: same size, same warm-red colour in all three
- NH₃ circles: small, blue, always inside the coordination sphere boundary
- Cl⁻ circles (free): green, floating outside, visually loose
- Cl⁻ circles (trapped): same green, but inside the sphere boundary
- Coordination sphere boundary: a thin dashed circle or rounded enclosure around the inner group
- White precipitate clumps: identical style, just different count (3, 2, 1)
- Solution colour matches compound colour (yellow, purple, green)

ARROW OR PROGRESSION:
A subtle horizontal arrow below all three panels pointing right, labelled "More Cl⁻ trapped inside →"

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "Yellow" (on left beaker)
- "Purple" (on center beaker)
- "Green" (on right beaker)
- "3 AgCl" (next to left precipitate)
- "2 AgCl" (next to center precipitate)
- "1 AgCl" (next to right precipitate)
- "Free Cl⁻" (pointing to any outside green circle)
- "Trapped Cl⁻" (pointing to any inside green circle)
- "More Cl⁻ trapped inside →" (on arrow below)

Simple diagrammatic style. Flat colours, not photorealistic.
