How absorption of one colour produces the complementary colour we see — three coordination compounds side by side.

LAYOUT: Three panels arranged horizontally, evenly spaced. Each panel follows the same visual structure: white light enters from the left, hits a complex in the centre, and coloured light exits to the right.

PANEL 1 — [Ti(H₂O)₆]³⁺:
A beam of WHITE light (shown as a glowing bundle of all rainbow colours fanning out slightly, or a bright white ray) approaches from the left and hits a small stylised octahedral complex at the centre (a purple-tinted metallic sphere with six smaller spheres around it).

The complex ABSORBS the blue-green band. Show this as blue-green wavelengths being "captured" — they stop at the complex. Small blue-green streaks sink into the complex (or fade/vanish at its surface).

The REMAINING light exits to the right as a VIOLET beam — visibly violet-coloured. This is the light we actually see.

PANEL 2 — [Cu(H₂O)₄]²⁺:
Same layout. White light enters from left. Hits a blue-tinted complex at centre. The complex absorbs the RED-ORANGE band — red-orange streaks vanish into the complex. The remaining light exits to the right as a BLUE beam.

PANEL 3 — [Ni(H₂O)₆]²⁺:
Same layout. White light enters from left. Hits a green-tinted complex at centre. The complex absorbs RED light — red streaks vanish into the complex. The remaining light exits to the right as a GREEN beam.

KEY VISUAL FEATURES:
- The incoming white light should look identical in all three panels — establishing that the SAME light enters each time
- The absorbed colour should be clearly REMOVED — shown disappearing into the complex, not bouncing off
- The outgoing light should be a distinctly different, vivid colour — the complement of what was absorbed
- The contrast between "colour absorbed" and "colour observed" must be unmistakable in each panel
- Complexes should look like small 3D clusters (a central sphere with surrounding smaller spheres), not abstract blobs

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "White light" (on the incoming beam, once on the far left — not repeated for each panel)
- "Absorbs blue-green" (small, near the complex in Panel 1)
- "We see violet" (small, near the outgoing beam in Panel 1)
- "Absorbs red-orange" (small, near the complex in Panel 2)
- "We see blue" (small, near the outgoing beam in Panel 2)
- "Absorbs red" (small, near the complex in Panel 3)
- "We see green" (small, near the outgoing beam in Panel 3)

NO chemical formulas. NO "Panel 1/2/3" labels. NO title. NO arrows beyond the light beams themselves. Clean, simple, and visually striking against a dark background.
