Three hydrate isomers of CrCl₃·6H₂O — same formula, different structures.

LAYOUT: Three octahedral complex diagrams side by side, left → center → right. Clear separation between panels.

Each panel shows a central Cr atom with six positions around it (octahedral). A subtle boundary (thin white circle or bracket) marks the coordination sphere — what's INSIDE vs OUTSIDE.

LEFT PANEL — [Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃:
- Central Cr (small bright sphere)
- All 6 octahedral positions: H₂O (small BLUE circles with "O" label)
- Lines from each H₂O to Cr (coordinate bonds)
- OUTSIDE the boundary: 3 Cl⁻ (GREEN spheres), floating freely, no bonds
- Below: "[Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃"
- Small colour tag: "Violet"

CENTER PANEL — [Cr(H₂O)₅Cl]Cl₂·H₂O:
- Central Cr
- 5 positions: H₂O (blue), 1 position: Cl⁻ (GREEN, INSIDE octahedron, bonded)
- OUTSIDE the boundary: 2 Cl⁻ (green, floating) + 1 H₂O (blue, floating)
- Below: "[Cr(H₂O)₅Cl]Cl₂·H₂O"
- Small colour tag: "Grey-green"

RIGHT PANEL — [Cr(H₂O)₄Cl₂]Cl·2H₂O:
- Central Cr
- 4 positions: H₂O (blue), 2 positions: Cl⁻ (GREEN, INSIDE, bonded)
- OUTSIDE the boundary: 1 Cl⁻ (green, floating) + 2 H₂O (blue, floating)
- Below: "[Cr(H₂O)₄Cl₂]Cl·2H₂O"
- Small colour tag: "Green"

KEY VISUAL INSIGHT:
- Left to right: Cl⁻ ions migrate from OUTSIDE → INSIDE the coordination sphere
- Left to right: H₂O molecules migrate from INSIDE → OUTSIDE
- The boundary between inside and outside is the crucial distinction
- Species INSIDE are bonded (lines to Cr). Species OUTSIDE are free (no lines, floating)

CRITICAL: The inside/outside boundary must be visually clear — the student should immediately see which species are bonded vs free. Use a subtle dotted circle or faint glow around the octahedral core.

COLOUR CODING:
- Blue = H₂O (consistent in all panels)
- Green = Cl⁻ (consistent in all panels)
- Coordinate bonds: thin white lines from ligand to Cr
- Items outside sphere: slightly dimmer, no connecting lines

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "Cr" at center of each octahedron
- Formulas below each panel
- Colour names below formulas
- Small legend: blue circle "H₂O" / green circle "Cl⁻"

Dark background (#151311). Clean diagrammatic style, not realistic 3D.
