Linkage isomerism — same NO₂⁻ ligand bonded through different atoms, producing different-coloured compounds.

LAYOUT: Two panels side by side, with a small central inset.

LEFT PANEL — NITRO ISOMER:
- Metal atom (labeled "Co") at center
- A bond line from Co to the NITROGEN atom of NO₂⁻
- The NO₂⁻ ligand shown clearly: N atom bonded to Co, with two O atoms branching off the N
- The N atom (the bonding atom) has a bright HIGHLIGHT RING around it
- Subtle YELLOW glow or colour wash behind this panel
- Below: "[Co(NH₃)₅(NO₂)]²⁺"
- Label: "Bonded through N → Yellow"

RIGHT PANEL — NITRITO ISOMER:
- Same metal atom (labeled "Co") at center
- A bond line from Co to an OXYGEN atom of NO₂⁻
- The NO₂⁻ ligand shown: O atom bonded to Co, with the chain going O–N–O
- The O atom (the bonding atom) has a bright HIGHLIGHT RING around it
- Subtle RED glow or colour wash behind this panel
- Below: "[Co(NH₃)₅(ONO)]²⁺"
- Label: "Bonded through O → Red"

CENTER INSET (small, between panels):
The NO₂⁻ ion shown alone with BOTH bonding options marked:
- Circle around N: "This end → yellow"
- Circle around O: "This end → red"
- Small label: "Ambidentate ligand"

KEY VISUAL INSIGHT:
Same ligand, FLIPPED. The bonding atom changes from N to O. That single flip changes the compound's colour from yellow to red.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "Co", "N", "O" on atoms
- Complex formulas below each panel
- "Bonded through N → Yellow" and "Bonded through O → Red"
- "Ambidentate ligand" in center inset

Dark background (#151311). Clean diagrammatic style.
