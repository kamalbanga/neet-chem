Double salt vs coordination compound — what happens when you dissolve each in water.

LAYOUT: Two panels, left and right, with clear vertical separation.

LEFT PANEL — "Double Salt":
TOP: A solid crystal chunk labeled "Mohr's salt"
ARROW pointing downward, labeled "Dissolve"
BOTTOM: Complete fragmentation — all ions scattered freely, floating independently with no connections:
- Fe²⁺ (small pale green sphere, labeled)
- Two NH₄⁺ (small blue spheres, labeled)
- Two SO₄²⁻ (small red clusters, labeled)
Every ion drifting separately. No bonds, no connections. Total breakup.
Subtext below: "Every ion free"

RIGHT PANEL — "Complex":
TOP: A solid crystal chunk labeled "K₄[Fe(CN)₆]"
ARROW pointing downward, labeled "Dissolve"
BOTTOM: Mixed result:
- Four K⁺ ions (small purple spheres, labeled) floating freely — scattered, no connections
- ONE INTACT [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ unit at center — Fe atom surrounded by 6 CN groups in an octahedral arrangement, all connected by bond lines. This unit has a subtle glow or boundary showing it stayed together as ONE piece.
Subtext below: "K⁺ free — core intact"

KEY VISUAL CONTRAST:
- Left: EVERYTHING scattered. No structure survives. Random ion soup.
- Right: K⁺ leaves, but the Fe-CN octahedral core is visibly intact and bonded. It looks like a solid unit floating among scattered K⁺ ions.
- The intact core should be the visual focus of the right panel — clearly cohesive and structural, contrasting with the scattered ions around it.

CRITICAL: The [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ core must look BONDED (lines connecting Fe to each CN). The free ions (K⁺, and everything in the left panel) must look UNBONDED (isolated spheres, no connecting lines).

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "Double salt" (left panel header)
- "Complex" (right panel header)
- "Mohr's salt" and "K₄[Fe(CN)₆]" (on crystals)
- "Dissolve" (on arrows)
- Ion labels: "Fe²⁺", "NH₄⁺", "SO₄²⁻", "K⁺", "[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻"
- "Every ion free" (left bottom)
- "K⁺ free — core intact" (right bottom)
