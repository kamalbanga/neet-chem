Two coordination compounds side by side — same ring structure, different metals, different jobs.

LEFT: A flat ring-like molecular framework (simplified porphyrin) gripping a glowing green sphere at its centre. Four bond connections from the ring converge on the sphere. A leaf silhouette faintly visible behind.

RIGHT: Same ring structure, but gripping a glowing red sphere at its centre. A red blood cell silhouette faintly visible behind.

Between them, a subtle connecting element showing these are the same TYPE of structure.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "Mg²⁺" (on green sphere, left)
- "Fe²⁺" (on red sphere, right)
- "Chlorophyll" (below left)
- "Haemoglobin" (below right)

NO other text. NO chemical formulas. Simple, iconic, flat rendering. The key visual message: the metal at the centre is what differs — the surrounding "grip" is the same idea.
