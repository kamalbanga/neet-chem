[COORD_T_001] Big Picture of Coordination Compounds

Haemoglobin carries oxygen. Chlorophyll captures sunlight. Both depend on a metal ion gripped by surrounding molecules. Swap those molecules, and the metal can't do its job.

coord-core-concept.webp

That grip — the specific arrangement of molecules around a metal ion — is what this chapter is about.

A `coordination compound` is a metal ion bonded to a cluster of surrounding species that shape its behaviour.

The metal sits at the centre. The surrounding species — called ligands — donate electron pairs to it. Change the ligands, and the compound's colour, reactivity, even its geometry can flip completely.

Three big questions run through this chapter.

First: how do you *describe* these compounds? The metal, its charge, the ligands, the overall structure — all need a systematic language.

Second: how can the *same* formula produce different compounds? Move a ligand between the coordination sphere and the outer shell, or swap which ligands sit next to each other. You get a genuinely different substance.

That's isomerism in coordination compounds.

Third: *why* do these compounds behave the way they do? Why is one complex bright red and another pale yellow? Why is one magnetic and another not?

Bonding theories answer this — they connect ligand arrangement to colour, magnetism, and stability.

Chlorophyll holds Mg²⁺ at its core. Haemoglobin wraps ligands around Fe²⁺. Vitamin B₁₂ coordinates around Co³⁺ — without it, nerve cells fail.

Every one of these is a coordination compound. The metal alone can't do the job. The ligands alone can't either. The *arrangement* is what matters.


[COORD_T_002] Werner's Theory

CoCl₃ combines with NH₃ in different ratios to form stable compounds.

Add AgNO₃ to detect free Cl⁻ — Ag⁺ grabs loose chloride and forms white AgCl precipitate. More free Cl⁻, more precipitate. Now test these three compounds.

CoCl₃·6NH₃ (yellow) gives 3 mol AgCl. All three Cl⁻ ions precipitate freely.

CoCl₃·5NH₃ (purple) gives only 2 mol AgCl. One Cl⁻ refuses to precipitate.

CoCl₃·4NH₃ gives just 1 mol AgCl. Two Cl⁻ ions stay locked in. This compound exists in two forms — green and violet — with identical formulas but different properties. Werner's first hint of isomerism.

Why can't AgNO₃ pull out every chloride? Some Cl⁻ ions must be bound to the metal differently — held so tightly they don't dissociate in solution.

Alfred Werner explained this with two types of valence.

`Primary valence` is the metal's normal ionic charge. For Co³⁺, it equals 3. Negative ions satisfy it, and these ions ionise freely in solution. They sit *outside* the coordination sphere.

`Secondary valence` is the number of groups directly attached to the metal ion. These groups — whether neutral molecules like NH₃ or negative ions like Cl⁻ — bind tightly and don't ionise.

Secondary valence equals the **coordination number**, and it stays fixed for a given metal ion.

Co³⁺ has a secondary valence of 6. Six groups always surround it.

In CoCl₃·6NH₃, all six NH₃ molecules fill the secondary valence. All three Cl⁻ remain ionic. So all three precipitate as AgCl.

In CoCl₃·5NH₃, five NH₃ fill five spots. One Cl⁻ enters the coordination sphere to complete six. That Cl⁻ is locked in. Only two Cl⁻ ions remain free to precipitate.

In CoCl₃·4NH₃, four NH₃ plus two Cl⁻ fill the six spots. Only one Cl⁻ stays ionic and precipitates.

werner-experiment.webp

werner-spheres.chem.svg

The pattern is clean. Every Cl⁻ inside the coordination sphere is invisible to AgNO₃. Every Cl⁻ outside precipitates immediately.

Werner also proposed that groups bound by secondary valence have fixed spatial arrangements. For coordination number 6, the geometry is **octahedral**.


[COORD_T_003] Double Salts vs Complexes

Mohr's salt and potassium ferrocyanide are both made by combining two simpler compounds. But dissolve them in water and something very different happens.

Mohr's salt — FeSO₄·(NH₄)₂SO₄·6H₂O — falls apart completely. Every ion goes free. You can detect Fe²⁺, NH₄⁺, and SO₄²⁻ separately. Potash alum and carnallite behave the same way.

A compound that dissociates completely like this is a `double salt`.

K₄[Fe(CN)₆] doesn't fall apart. K⁺ ions go free, but [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ stays intact. No free Fe²⁺ or CN⁻ in solution. The metal-ligand core survives — that's what makes it a complex.

double-salt-vs-complex.webp

That's the key test. Dissolve, then probe for individual ions. All free — double salt. Core intact — complex.


[COORD_T_004] Coordination Entity and Coordination Number

Werner showed that six groups always cluster around Co³⁺. But what holds them there?

The metal ion has empty orbitals. Each surrounding molecule or ion has a lone pair to donate. The metal accepts electron pairs — making it a Lewis acid. Each ligand donates a pair — making it a Lewis base.

The metal ion plus its directly bonded ligands form a `coordination entity`. In [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺, cobalt and its six NH₃ ligands together are the coordination entity.

In [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻, it's Fe²⁺ with six CN⁻.

The `central atom` (or `central ion`) is the metal at the heart. The `ligands` are the electron-pair donors surrounding it.

How many bonds does the metal form? That's the `coordination number` — the number of *donor atoms* directly bonded to the metal through σ bonds.

For simple ligands like Cl⁻, NH₃, or H₂O, each ligand contributes one donor atom. Six such ligands give CN = 6.

But some ligands donate through more than one atom. Ethane-1,2-diamine (en) bonds through *two* nitrogen atoms. So each en contributes 2 to the coordination number.

[Co(en)₃]³⁺ has only three ligand molecules. But each en donates twice — so CN = 6, not 3.

cn-counting.chem.svg

The count is always about donor atoms, never about ligand molecules. Only σ bonds count — π bonds don't add to the coordination number.


[COORD_T_005] Types of Ligands: Denticity

Cl⁻ bonds to a metal through one atom. EDTA⁴⁻ bonds through six at once, wrapping around the metal like a cage.

The number of donor atoms a single ligand uses is its `denticity` — from the Latin word for tooth. How many teeth does the ligand sink into the metal?

A `unidentate` ligand has one donor atom. Cl⁻ donates through chlorine. H₂O through oxygen. NH₃ through nitrogen. One bond each.

A `didentate` ligand has two donor atoms. Ethane-1,2-diamine (en) has two –NH₂ groups — both nitrogens bond to the metal. Oxalate (C₂O₄²⁻) bonds through two oxygen atoms.

A `polydentate` ligand has several donor atoms. The more donor atoms, the higher the denticity.

The champion is EDTA⁴⁻ — a `hexadentate` ligand. It bonds through six atoms at once: two nitrogen atoms (from amino groups) and four oxygen atoms (from carboxylate groups).

One EDTA molecule wraps around a metal ion and fills all six coordination positions by itself.

edta-hexadentate.chem.svg

| Denticity | Type | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Unidentate | Cl⁻, H₂O, NH₃, CN⁻ |
| 2 | Didentate | en, C₂O₄²⁻ |
| 6 | Hexadentate | EDTA⁴⁻ |


[COORD_T_006] Chelate and Ambidentate Ligands

Six separate NH₃ molecules surround a metal. Pull one off — it drifts into solution, gone. Replace those six with three en molecules. Pull one arm of en away — the other arm still holds, and the freed arm snaps right back.

Why the difference? When en bonds through both its nitrogen atoms, it forms a ring around the metal. That ring grips like a claw — the Greek word is *chele*.

A ligand that forms such a ring is a `chelate ligand`, and the complex is a `chelate complex`.

chelate-effect.chem.svg

The tether keeps each donor atom near the metal. A detached arm dangles close, ready to reattach. Six separate unidentate ligands have no such safety net. This extra stability is the **chelate effect**.

A different kind of flexibility exists in `ambidentate` ligands. These have two *different* donor atoms, and the ligand bonds through either one — but not both at once.

NO₂⁻ can bond through nitrogen (–NO₂) or through oxygen (–ONO). SCN⁻ can bond through sulphur (–SCN) or nitrogen (–NCS).

Same ligand, different bonding atom. This matters for isomerism — swapping which atom bonds to the metal creates a different compound.


[COORD_T_007] Coordination Sphere, Counter Ions, and Complex Types

Dissolve [Co(NH₃)₆]Cl₃ in water. The three Cl⁻ ions drift away — add AgNO₃ and they precipitate as AgCl. But the [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ core stays locked together. No free Co³⁺ or NH₃ anywhere.

The square brackets in the formula mark this boundary. Everything inside is the `coordination sphere` — the metal and its directly bonded ligands. This unit stays intact in solution.

Everything outside is a `counter ion` — free to dissociate.

In K₄[Fe(CN)₆], the coordination sphere is [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻. The four K⁺ are counter ions.

Two more labels describe the ligand mix inside the coordination sphere.

A `homoleptic` complex has only one kind of ligand. [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ — six identical NH₃ molecules. [Ni(CO)₄] — four identical CO molecules.

A `heteroleptic` complex has more than one kind. [Co(NH₃)₄Cl₂]⁺ — NH₃ and Cl⁻ together. Most real coordination compounds are heteroleptic.


[COORD_T_008] Shapes and Oxidation Number

Six ligands around a metal repel each other — same logic as VSEPR for covalent molecules. They push apart as far as possible, settling into an **octahedral** shape — the most common geometry.

Four ligands give two possibilities: **tetrahedral** or **square planar**. Which one forms depends on the metal, the ligands, and how the metal's orbitals hybridise.

Five ligands give **trigonal bipyramidal** — but this is rare in coordination chemistry at this level.

These spatial arrangements are called `coordination polyhedra`.

coord-shapes.chem.svg

Now, the metal's charge. Strip away every ligand along with the electron pairs it donated. The charge left on the metal is its `oxidation number`.

To calculate it: set up a charge balance. The overall charge of the coordination entity equals the metal's oxidation number plus the total charge from all ligands.

In [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺: NH₃ is neutral. Overall charge is +3. So Co = +3, written as Co(III).

In [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻: each CN⁻ contributes −1, six of them give −6. Overall charge is −4. So Fe + (−6) = −4, meaning Fe = +2, written as Fe(II).

In [PtCl₄]²⁻: each Cl⁻ gives −1, four give −4. Overall charge is −2. So Pt = +2, written as Pt(II).

Oxidation numbers are always written as Roman numerals in parentheses after the metal name.


[COORD_T_009] Naming Ligands in Coordination Compounds

NH₃ in a coordination name isn't called ammonia — it's `ammine`, with double m. H₂O becomes `aqua`, not water. CO is `carbonyl`. NO is `nitrosyl`.

These four special names must be memorised as-is. All other neutral ligands keep their usual names.

Anionic ligands get an **-o** suffix. Chloride becomes chlorido, bromide becomes bromido, cyanide becomes cyanido, hydroxide becomes hydroxido, sulphate becomes sulphato, oxalate becomes oxalato.

How do you indicate multiples? For simple ligand names, use the Greek prefixes: di, tri, tetra, penta, hexa.

Dichlorido means two Cl⁻. Triammine means three NH₃. Hexacyanido means six CN⁻.

But some ligand names already contain a number — like ethane-1,2-diamine (it has "di" built in). Using "di" again would cause confusion.

So for these, use `bis`, `tris`, `tetrakis` instead, and enclose the ligand name in parentheses.

Bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) — clear. Diethane-1,2-diamine — confusing.

| Ligand type | Naming rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Anionic | Add -o | Cl⁻ → chlorido |
| Neutral (general) | Keep name | PPh₃ → triphenylphosphine |
| Neutral (special) | Memorise | H₂O → aqua, NH₃ → ammine |


[COORD_T_010] IUPAC Naming and Formulas

Name the cation first, anion second — same order as any ionic compound. Whether or not the complex is the cation doesn't matter.

Second: within the coordination entity, list ligands alphabetically *before* the metal.

After the ligands, write the metal's name. Add the oxidation state in Roman numerals: cobalt(III), platinum(II).

What if the complex is an anion? The metal gets an `-ate` suffix. Cobalt becomes cobaltate. Platinum becomes platinate. But some metals use their Latin roots: iron becomes `ferrate`, silver becomes `argentate`.

Compare: [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ is hexaamminecobalt(III) — no suffix, because it's a cation. [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ is hexacyanidoferrate(II) — Latin root plus -ate, because it's an anion.

Now the formula. Here's the trap: formula order is *opposite* to naming order.

In the name, ligands come first, metal second. In the formula, metal comes first, then ligands alphabetically. The whole coordination entity sits inside square brackets.

For [Ag(NH₃)₂][Ag(CN)₂], the name is diamminesilver(I) dicyanidoargentate(I). The cation is named first. The anionic metal gets the -ate suffix with the Latin root.

One last detail: the charge of cations must balance anions. K₃[Fe(CN)₆] has three K⁺ outside to balance the 3⁻ charge on the complex.

The alphabetical rule ignores prefixes. "Ammine" comes before "chlorido" — the di/tri/hexa doesn't count.


[COORD_T_011] Big Picture of Isomerism

Same formula, different compound. That's an `isomer`.

Werner spotted this early. CoCl₃·4NH₃ gives two distinct compounds — one green, one violet. Identical formula. Different colours, different properties. Something about the internal arrangement differs.

Two families of isomers exist.

`Structural isomerism`: the atoms form *different bonds*. A ligand bonds through a different atom, or swaps places with a counter ion. The connectivity itself changes.

`Stereoisomerism`: the bonds are identical, but the *spatial arrangement* differs. Same atoms bonded to the same partners, just positioned differently in 3D space.

Structural isomers come in four types: linkage, coordination, ionisation, and solvate. Stereoisomers come in two: geometrical and optical.

Every type answers one question: what changed? For structural isomers — *which* atoms are bonded. For stereoisomers — *where* those atoms sit in space.

isomerism-tree.chem.svg


[COORD_T_012] Linkage and Coordination Isomerism

[Co(NH₃)₅(NO₂)]²⁺ is yellow. [Co(NH₃)₅(ONO)]²⁺ is red. Same formula, same atoms. The only difference — which end of the NO₂⁻ faces the metal.

NO₂⁻ can bond through nitrogen (M–NO₂) or through oxygen (M–ONO). Nitrogen-bonded is yellow. Oxygen-bonded is red.

linkage-isomerism.webp

Same ligand, different donor atom, different compound. That's `linkage isomerism`. It needs an ambidentate ligand — one with two different atoms that can each bond to the metal.

`Coordination isomerism` requires two metal centres — one in the cation, one in the anion. The ligands swap between them.

[Co(NH₃)₆][Cr(CN)₆] has all NH₃ on cobalt and all CN⁻ on chromium. Its coordination isomer [Cr(NH₃)₆][Co(CN)₆] reverses this — NH₃ goes to chromium, CN⁻ goes to cobalt.

Both metals keep CN 6. Both complexes have the same overall formula. But the ligand distribution between the two metals is different.


[COORD_T_013] Ionisation and Solvate Isomerism

Add AgNO₃ to [Co(NH₃)₅(SO₄)]Br — white precipitate. Free Br⁻ reacts with Ag⁺.

Add BaCl₂ to the same compound — nothing. SO₄²⁻ is trapped inside the coordination sphere.

Now test [Co(NH₃)₅Br]SO₄. AgNO₃ gives nothing — Br⁻ is locked inside. BaCl₂ gives a precipitate — SO₄²⁻ is free.

Same formula, opposite test results. A ligand and a counter ion swapped places. That's `ionisation isomerism`.

`Solvate isomerism` (called `hydrate isomerism` when water is the solvent) works the same way — but the swapping species is a solvent molecule.

[Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃ is violet. All six waters are ligands. CN = 6.

[Cr(H₂O)₅Cl]Cl₂·H₂O is grey-green. One water moved outside. One chloride moved inside. CN is still 6.

A third isomer exists too: [Cr(H₂O)₄Cl₂]Cl·2H₂O. Two waters out, two chlorides in. CN remains 6 in every case.

hydrate-isomers.webp

Same atoms, same count. But what's inside the coordination sphere changes — and that changes everything: colour, reactivity, which ions are free in solution.


[COORD_T_014] Geometrical Isomerism in Square Planar Complexes

A platinum compound cures cancer. Swap two of its ligands to opposite corners — same formula, same bonds — and it becomes useless. The only difference is *where* the ligands sit.

The compound is [Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂]. Platinum sits at the centre of a square, with four positions at the corners. Two are NH₃, two are Cl⁻.

Place both chlorides next to each other. This is the `cis isomer` — identical ligands on the same side. Cis-[Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂] is the cancer drug cisplatin.

Now move the chlorides to opposite corners. This is the `trans isomer` — identical ligands across from each other. Trans-[Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂] has no anticancer activity at all.

sq-cis-trans.chem.svg

Same atoms, same bonds, different arrangement in space. That's `geometrical isomerism`. It only needs two different types of ligands around the metal.

Why doesn't this happen in tetrahedral complexes? In a tetrahedron, every corner is the same distance from every other. There's no "next to" versus "across from."

Rearrange the ligands — you always get the same compound. No distinct cis or trans forms exist.

What if all four ligands are different — type [MABXL]? Pick any one ligand. One other sits across from it (trans). Two sit beside it (cis). That gives three geometrical isomers.


[COORD_T_015] Geometrical Isomerism in Octahedral Complexes

[Co(NH₃)₄Cl₂]⁺ comes in two colours — violet and green. Same formula, same octahedral shape. Where the two Cl⁻ sit among six positions makes all the difference.

In [MX₂L₄] — two of one ligand, four of another — the two X ligands can be adjacent (cis) or opposite (trans). [Co(NH₃)₄Cl₂]⁺ exists in both forms.

Didentate ligands create the same situation. In [CoCl₂(en)₂]⁺, the two chlorides can be cis or trans. The en ligands each span two adjacent positions.

A different pattern appears when three of each ligand are present — [Ma₃b₃] complexes like [Co(NH₃)₃(NO₂)₃].

The three identical ligands can occupy one triangular face of the octahedron. Picture three NH₃ molecules forming a triangle on one side. This is the `facial` (`fac`) isomer.

Or the three identical ligands can span a meridian — lying in a plane that includes the metal and slices the octahedron in half.

Two are opposite each other, one is perpendicular to them. This is the `meridional` (`mer`) isomer.

Fac puts all three on one face. Mer spreads them around the middle.

oct-fac-mer.chem.svg


[COORD_T_016] Optical Isomerism and Counting Isomers

Hold your left hand up to a mirror. The reflection looks like your right hand. You can't overlap them perfectly — they're non-superimposable mirror images.

Some coordination compounds behave the same way. Their mirror image can't be superimposed on the original. These non-superimposable mirror images are called `enantiomers`, and the molecule is `chiral`.

`Optical isomerism` gets its name from how you detect it. Pass plane-polarised light through a solution of one enantiomer. The plane of light rotates.

The `dextro (d)` form rotates light to the right. The `laevo (l)` form rotates it to the left.

Equal and opposite rotation — same magnitude, different direction.

Where does this appear? Commonly in octahedral complexes with didentate ligands. [Co(en)₃]³⁺ has three en ligands wrapping around cobalt. Its mirror image is a different compound — a pair of enantiomers.

optical-mirror.chem.svg

Here's the key rule: in complexes like [MX₂(L-L)₂], only the cis isomer is optically active. The trans isomer has a plane of symmetry, so its mirror image *is* superimposable. No chirality.

This gives you a method for counting total isomers. Take [CoCl₂(en)₂]⁺.

First, count geometric isomers: cis and trans — that's 2.

Then check each for optical activity. Trans has a symmetry plane — no enantiomers. Cis lacks that symmetry — it has an enantiomeric pair.

Total: 3 distinct isomers (cis-d, cis-l, trans).


[COORD_T_017] Why Bonding Theories?

Werner figured out *what* coordination compounds look like — octahedral, tetrahedral, square planar. He mapped which ligands attach where. But he left three puzzles unsolved.

First: colour. [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ is yellow-orange. [Co(NH₃)₅(H₂O)]³⁺ is red. Same metal, same oxidation state, same coordination number. Only one ligand changed. Why does that shift the colour?

Second: magnetism. [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ has zero unpaired electrons — diamagnetic. [CoF₆]³⁻ has four unpaired electrons — strongly paramagnetic.

Same Co³⁺, same octahedral shape. NH₃ somehow forces electrons to pair up. F⁻ doesn't. Why?

Third: ligand strength. NH₃ is a neutral molecule. F⁻ carries a full negative charge. You'd expect the charged ion to grip the metal harder. Yet NH₃ is the stronger ligand. That defies simple electrostatics.

three-puzzles.webp

Two theories tackle these puzzles.

`Valence Bond Theory` (VBT) uses hybridisation of metal orbitals to predict geometry and magnetic behaviour. It came first historically.

`Crystal Field Theory` (CFT) treats ligands as point charges that split the metal's d orbitals. That splitting explains colour, magnetism, *and* ligand strength in one framework.

VBT answers geometry and magnetism well. But it can't explain colour at all, and it can't say *why* certain ligands force pairing. CFT fills exactly those gaps.


[COORD_T_018] Valence Bond Theory: Framework

sp³ makes methane tetrahedral. sp² makes ethene flat. Metals use the same hybridisation idea — but with d orbitals in the mix.

A metal ion has empty orbitals. A ligand has a lone pair. In VBT, the metal hybridises its orbitals to create a set of equivalent empty slots. Each ligand donates its electron pair into one slot, forming a coordinate bond.

The type of hybridisation decides the geometry.

*sp³* gives four equivalent orbitals pointing to the corners of a tetrahedron. *dsp²* also gives four orbitals, but arranged in a square plane. The 'd' orbital involved is from the same shell as s and p.

*sp³d* gives five orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement.

For six-coordinate complexes, two options exist. *d²sp³* uses two inner d orbitals (from the n−1 shell). *sp³d²* uses two outer d orbitals (from the n shell). Both produce octahedral geometry.

| Hybridisation | Geometry |
|---|---|
| sp³ | Tetrahedral |
| dsp² | Square planar |
| sp³d² or d²sp³ | Octahedral |

The key idea: once you know the hybridisation, you know the shape. And hybridisation depends on how the metal's electrons rearrange to make room for ligand pairs.


[COORD_T_019] Magnetic Properties of Coordination Compounds

[Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ has zero unpaired electrons. [CoF₆]³⁻ has four. A magnet can tell them apart instantly.

A substance with unpaired electrons gets pulled toward a magnet — it's `paramagnetic`. Each unpaired electron acts like a tiny magnet. More unpaired electrons, stronger pull.

When all electrons are paired, their fields cancel. The substance gets weakly pushed away. That's `diamagnetic`.

Paramagnetism can be measured. The strength of attraction gives a number called the `magnetic moment`, measured in `Bohr Magnetons` (BM).

For transition metal complexes, magnetic moment depends almost entirely on how many electrons are unpaired. The formula:

μ = √(n(n+2)) BM

where n = number of unpaired electrons.

| n | μ (BM) |
|---|---|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1.73 |
| 2 | 2.83 |
| 3 | 3.87 |
| 4 | 4.90 |
| 5 | 5.92 |

This is called the spin-only formula — it counts only the spin contribution of electrons.

Measure μ, work backwards to find n, and you know how electrons are arranged inside the complex. Magnetic data becomes a window into structure.


[COORD_T_020] VBT: Octahedral Complexes

[Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ is diamagnetic — zero unpaired electrons. [CoF₆]³⁻ has four. Same Co³⁺, same octahedral shape. What makes the difference?

Co³⁺ is d⁶ — six electrons in five 3d orbitals. In the free ion, Hund's rule gives four unpaired electrons.

Now add six NH₃ ligands. [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ is experimentally diamagnetic — zero unpaired electrons. All six d electrons must have paired up, cramming into just three 3d orbitals. That frees up two 3d orbitals.

Those two empty 3d orbitals combine with the 4s and three 4p orbitals to form six d²sp³ hybrid orbitals. Six NH₃ molecules donate their lone pairs into these six slots.

The d orbitals used here are from the inner (n−1) shell — the 3d shell. So this is called an `inner orbital complex`.

Because electrons were forced to pair, it's also called a `low spin` complex. μ = 0 BM.

Now replace NH₃ with F⁻. [CoF₆]³⁻ is paramagnetic with four unpaired electrons. The d electrons haven't rearranged at all — they stay spread out as in the free ion. No 3d orbitals are free for hybridisation.

Instead, two 4d orbitals (the outer shell) join 4s and 4p to form sp³d² hybrids. This is an `outer orbital complex` — also called `high spin`. μ = √(4×6) = 4.90 BM.

vbt-orbital-boxes.chem.svg

Same metal, same charge, same geometry. But NH₃ forces electron pairing while F⁻ doesn't.

VBT describes this difference but can't explain *why* it happens. It just observes that some ligands cause inner orbital complexes and others cause outer orbital ones — without predicting which ligands do what.


[COORD_T_021] VBT: Tetrahedral and Square Planar Complexes

[NiCl₄]²⁻ is tetrahedral and paramagnetic. [Ni(CN)₄]²⁻ is square planar and diamagnetic. Same Ni²⁺, same coordination number 4. How does one metal give two completely different shapes?

Ni²⁺ is d⁸ — eight electrons in five 3d orbitals. Three orbitals are fully paired, two hold single electrons. Two unpaired in the free ion.

In [NiCl₄]²⁻, those two electrons stay unpaired. No rearrangement. The 4s and three 4p orbitals hybridise into sp³. Four Cl⁻ ligands donate into these. Geometry: tetrahedral. μ = √(2×4) = 2.83 BM — paramagnetic.

[Ni(CO)₄] is different. Ni is in the zero oxidation state here — d¹⁰. All five 3d orbitals are full. No unpaired electrons. Again sp³ hybridisation, tetrahedral geometry. But now μ = 0 — diamagnetic.

Now consider [Ni(CN)₄]²⁻. Ni²⁺ is still d⁸, but this complex is diamagnetic. That means the two unpaired electrons have been forced to pair. They squeeze into other 3d orbitals, freeing one 3d orbital.

That freed 3d orbital joins the 4s and two 4p orbitals to form four `dsp²` hybrids. Four CN⁻ ligands donate into these. Geometry: square planar. μ = 0 BM.

So Ni²⁺ with Cl⁻ is tetrahedral and paramagnetic. Ni²⁺ with CN⁻ is square planar and diamagnetic. Both have coordination number 4.

ni-sp3-vs-dsp2.chem.svg

VBT can describe each case *after* you know the magnetic data. But it has clear limitations.

It can't predict which ligands force pairing and which don't. You must measure the magnetic moment first — only then can VBT "explain" the result.

It can't explain colour. Why is [Ti(H₂O)₆]³⁺ violet? VBT has no answer — it doesn't deal with energy gaps between orbitals.

It can't distinguish the relative strengths of different ligands, or predict why one geometry forms over another from first principles.

These are serious gaps. Describing results after the fact is useful — but predicting outcomes is what a complete theory should do.


[COORD_T_022] Crystal Field Theory: Octahedral Splitting

In a free metal ion, all five d orbitals have the same energy. An electron in any one is equally comfortable. No orbital is special.

Now surround that ion with six ligands. `Crystal Field Theory` asks one question: what do six negative charges do to those d orbitals?

CFT's approach is radical. Forget bonding. Forget orbital overlap. Treat each ligand as nothing more than a point of negative charge.

Six points, arranged along the x, y, and z axes — one at each end.

Every d electron now faces repulsion from these six charges. All five d orbitals rise in energy. But they don't all rise equally.

Why? Because d orbitals have lobes pointing in specific directions. And the ligands sit at specific spots. The match-up between lobe direction and ligand position decides everything.

d-orbital-vs-ligands.chem.svg

d_{x²−y²} has four lobes stretched along the x and y axes. Four ligands sit right there.

An electron in this orbital spends most of its time near those ligands. Close means strong repulsion. This orbital gets pushed to high energy.

d_{z²} has main lobes along the z axis — aimed at the remaining two ligands. Same story. Strong repulsion, high energy.

Now d_{xy}. Its four lobes point at 45° — between the x and y axes. The ligands are on the axes, not between them.

An electron here stays in the gaps, far from the ligands. Weaker repulsion, lower energy.

d_{xz} and d_{yz} do the same. Lobes between axes. Electrons dodge ligands.

Five d orbitals split into two groups. d_{x²−y²} and d_{z²} aim at ligands — pushed up. d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz} aim between — pushed down.

oct-splitting.chem.svg

The lower three are labelled `t₂g`. The upper two are labelled `eg`. The energy gap between them is `Δo` — "o" for octahedral. This separation is `crystal field splitting`.

Energy is conserved. Each t₂g orbital drops by (2/5)Δo below the average. Each eg orbital rises by (3/5)Δo above it. Check: 3(−0.4Δo) + 2(+0.6Δo) = 0. ✓

What decides the size of Δo? Two things.

The ligand — stronger field ligands repel d electrons harder, widening the gap.

The metal's charge — higher charge pulls ligands closer, so the difference between "aimed at" and "aimed between" grows.


[COORD_T_023] Spectrochemical Series

F⁻ carries a full negative charge. NH₃ is neutral. You'd expect the charged ion to grip the metal harder. Yet NH₃ produces much larger crystal field splitting than F⁻.

How do we know? Measure the absorption wavelength for complexes with different ligands. Rank them by how much they split the d orbitals, and a consistent order appears.

This ranking is the `spectrochemical series`, from weakest to strongest:

Weak end: I⁻ < Br⁻ < SCN⁻ < Cl⁻ < S²⁻ < F⁻ < OH⁻

Middle: C₂O₄²⁻ < H₂O < NCS⁻ < EDTA⁴⁻

Strong end: NH₃ < en < CN⁻ < CO

Most anions cluster at the weak end. Neutral molecules like NH₃ and the strong-field ligands CN⁻ and CO sit at the top.

Ligands producing small splitting are `weak field ligands`. Those producing large splitting are `strong field ligands`.

This ranking is experimental — measured from absorption spectra. If charge alone mattered, F⁻ would beat NH₃. It doesn't.

One pattern: halides are σ-only donors — they push electrons toward the metal but nothing more. CN⁻ and CO do something extra — they accept electrons *back* from the metal's filled d orbitals into their own empty orbitals. This two-way interaction strengthens the bond and widens the splitting.

sigma-vs-pi-splitting.chem.svg

That's why neutral CO sits at the top while charged F⁻ stays near the bottom.

The practical use is direct. Given a metal ion and its ligands, check where the ligands fall in the series. That tells you whether Δo is large or small — which predicts colour and magnetic behaviour.


[COORD_T_024] High Spin vs Low Spin in CFT

For d¹, d², d³ — no conflict. t₂g has three orbitals. Each electron gets its own space.

At d⁴, a real choice appears. The three t₂g orbitals are half-filled. The fourth electron faces two options.

Jump up to an empty eg orbital. That climb costs energy — exactly Δo. But the electron gets its own orbital. No crowding.

Or stay in t₂g and pair up with an electron already there. No climbing cost. But forcing two electrons into the same orbital creates repulsion. That repulsion cost is the `pairing energy` (P).

Two costs compete. Δo versus P. Which is smaller decides the outcome.

If Δo < P, climbing is cheaper. The electron enters eg. Electrons spread across all five orbitals — more unpaired, higher magnetic moment. This is a `high spin` complex.

Weak field ligands produce small Δo. Small splitting can't justify the pain of pairing. So they give high spin.

If Δo > P, pairing is cheaper. The electron stays in t₂g. Fewer unpaired, lower magnetic moment. This is a `low spin` complex.

Strong field ligands produce large Δo. The gap is so large that climbing costs more than pairing. So they give low spin.

high-low-spin.chem.svg

Same metal, same charge, same shape. The ligand alone decides. And you can tell which happened — hold the complex near a magnet.

This competition matters for d⁴, d⁵, d⁶, and d⁷. These are the only configurations where high spin and low spin differ.

d¹ through d³: t₂g has room. No pairing needed regardless.

d⁸ through d¹⁰: t₂g is full. Electrons must enter eg regardless. Both fields give the same result.


[COORD_T_025] Electron Filling, CFSE, and Magnetic Moments

[Fe(CN)₆]³⁻ has one unpaired electron. [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ has five. Same Fe³⁺, same d⁵, same octahedral shape. Only the ligand differs. Here's how to predict this from scratch.

Five steps, always in this order:
1. Find the metal's oxidation state and count its d electrons.
2. Check the ligand — strong or weak field — using the spectrochemical series.
3. Fill electrons into t₂g and eg accordingly.
4. Count unpaired electrons (n).
5. Calculate μ = √(n(n+2)) BM.

Take [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻. Fe is +3, so it's d⁵. CN⁻ is a strong field ligand. All five electrons pack into t₂g: t₂g⁵ eg⁰. One electron remains unpaired. μ = √(1×3) = 1.73 BM. Weakly paramagnetic.

Now take [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺. Same Fe³⁺, same d⁵. But H₂O is a weak field ligand. Electrons spread out: t₂g³ eg². All five are unpaired. μ = √(5×7) = 5.92 BM. Strongly paramagnetic.

Same metal ion, different ligand, completely different magnetic behaviour.

fe-d5-cft-filling.chem.svg

Each electron placement also carries an energy cost or benefit. An electron in t₂g sits below the average energy — it stabilises the complex by −0.4Δo.

An electron in eg sits above — it *destabilises* by +0.6Δo.

Add up contributions from all d electrons and you get the `crystal field stabilisation energy` (**CFSE**).

For [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻ (t₂g⁵ eg⁰): CFSE = 5(−0.4Δo) + 0(+0.6Δo) = −2.0Δo.

For [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ (t₂g³ eg²): CFSE = 3(−0.4Δo) + 2(+0.6Δo) = 0. No net stabilisation.

In tetrahedral complexes, the splitting energy is Δt = (4/9)Δo. Tetrahedral CFSE values are calculated the same way but are much smaller.


[COORD_T_026] Crystal Field Splitting in Tetrahedral Complexes

Octahedral splitting pushes d_{x²-y²} and d_{z²} up because ligands aim straight at them. Move ligands to a tetrahedron's corners, and the splitting flips.

Picture a cube with the metal at the centre. In a tetrahedron, ligands sit at four of the eight corners — alternating corners, so no two are on the same face.

d_{x²-y²} and d_{z²} aim along the x, y, z axes — toward the *centres* of cube faces. d_{xy}, d_{yz}, d_{xz} aim toward the *edges* — closer to where the tetrahedral ligands actually sit.

So the splitting inverts. d_{xy}, d_{yz}, d_{xz} feel more repulsion and go up — called `t₂` (three orbitals). d_{x²-y²} and d_{z²} go down — called `e` (two orbitals).

The energy gap between them is `Δt`.

Notice: no 'g' subscript. The 'g' in t₂g and eg stands for *gerade* — a symmetry label that only applies when the complex has a centre of symmetry.

Octahedral and square planar complexes have one. Tetrahedral complexes don't. So the labels are simply e and t₂.

tet-vs-oct-splitting.chem.svg

The key fact: Δt = (4/9)Δo. That's less than half the octahedral splitting for the same metal and ligand.

When splitting is small, the energy cost of jumping to the higher set is low. Electrons would rather spread out than pair up. Pairing energy almost always wins over Δt.

So tetrahedral complexes are almost always high spin. Low spin tetrahedral complexes are extremely rare — the splitting is simply too small to force pairing.


[COORD_T_027] Colour in Coordination Compounds

[Ti(H₂O)₆]³⁺ is violet. [Cu(H₂O)₄]²⁺ is blue. [Ni(H₂O)₆]²⁺ is green. Where does this colour come from?

The d orbitals are split. An electron sitting in t₂g can absorb a photon of light and jump up to eg. This is a `d-d transition`. The energy of the photon it absorbs equals Δo.

d-d-transition.chem.svg

White light is a mix of all visible wavelengths. Remove one band, and the remaining wavelengths blend into a new colour — the `complementary colour` of what was absorbed.

Each absorbed colour has exactly one complement. Blue-green and violet are complementary. Red and green are complementary.

[Ti(H₂O)₆]³⁺ absorbs blue-green light. The leftover wavelengths mix to give violet.

complementary-colour.webp

Stronger ligand means larger Δo. Larger Δo means the electron absorbs a higher-energy, *shorter-wavelength* photon. So changing the ligand changes the colour.

This is why [Ni(H₂O)₆]²⁺ is green but [Ni(en)₃]²⁺ is violet. The en ligand is stronger than H₂O in the spectrochemical series.

No ligand means no splitting. No splitting means no d-d transition. No transition means no colour.

Anhydrous CuSO₄ is white — Cu²⁺ has no ligands to split its d orbitals. Add water and you get CuSO₄·5H₂O — blue, because H₂O ligands create a crystal field.

Two special cases are always colourless. d⁰ ions have no electron to excite. d¹⁰ ions have all d orbitals full — no empty orbital to jump *into*.

CFT explains colour well, but has a limitation. If ligands were pure point charges, anionic ligands like F⁻ and Cl⁻ should produce the strongest field.

They don't — they sit at the weak end of the spectrochemical series. CFT ignores covalent character in the metal-ligand bond. More advanced theories fix this, but they are beyond syllabus.


[COORD_T_028] Bonding in Metal Carbonyls

CO sits at the very top of the spectrochemical series — stronger than every charged ion. A neutral molecule beating F⁻, Cl⁻, all of them. Where does that strength come from?

The answer: CO bonds to the metal in two ways at once. This is what makes `metal carbonyls` — complexes with only CO ligands — so stable.

First, the carbon end of CO has a lone pair. This lone pair donates into an empty metal orbital, forming a normal σ bond. The direction is C → M.

This is the same kind of ligand-to-metal donation you've seen with NH₃ or H₂O.

Second, something new happens. The metal has filled d orbitals. CO has empty antibonding π* orbitals.

Metal d electrons flow *back* into these π* orbitals on CO. This is called `π backbonding`, and its direction is M → C.

These two donations reinforce each other. When CO donates electron density to the metal through the σ bond, the metal becomes slightly electron-rich.

That makes it donate *more* back through the π bond. Which in turn makes CO donate more through σ. This mutual strengthening is called `synergic bonding`.

synergic-bonding.chem.svg

The M−C bond gets stronger because of double bonding character. The C−O bond gets slightly weaker because electrons fill its antibonding orbital.

Common metal carbonyls follow predictable geometries. Ni(CO)₄ is tetrahedral. Fe(CO)₅ is trigonal bipyramidal. Cr(CO)₆ is octahedral.

Some carbonyls contain two metal atoms linked by a **metal-metal bond**. Mn₂(CO)₁₀ has a direct Mn−Mn bond joining two Mn(CO)₅ units. Co₂(CO)₈ has a Co−Co bond with two bridging CO groups.


[COORD_T_029] Applications: Analytical and Metallurgical

Your tap water might contain dissolved Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺. How do you measure how much? Titrate with EDTA.

EDTA wraps around each metal ion as a hexadentate chelate, forming a very stable complex. The endpoint tells you the total hardness.

For detecting Ni²⁺ in qualitative analysis, add `DMG` (dimethylglyoxime). Ni²⁺ forms a bright rose-red chelate with DMG — a distinctive colour test.

Gold extraction depends on complex formation. Crushed gold ore is treated with CN⁻ in the presence of oxygen and water. Gold dissolves as [Au(CN)₂]⁻.

To recover the metal, add zinc — it displaces gold from the complex.

The `Mond process` purifies nickel. Impure nickel reacts with CO to form volatile Ni(CO)₄. This gas is carried away from the impurities.

Heat it and it decomposes, depositing pure nickel. The CO recycles back.

Electroplating uses coordination compounds too. Silver and gold plate more smoothly from [Ag(CN)₂]⁻ and [Au(CN)₂]⁻ solutions than from simple metal ion solutions. The complex releases metal slowly, giving an even deposit.

In black-and-white photography, unexposed AgBr on the film must be washed away. Hypo solution (sodium thiosulphate) dissolves it by forming the complex [Ag(S₂O₃)₂]³⁻.


[COORD_T_030] Applications: Biological and Medicinal

A coordination compound in your blood is carrying the oxygen you breathe right now. Another one in every green leaf traps sunlight. These aren't rare lab chemicals — coordination chemistry runs life.

**Chlorophyll** holds Mg²⁺ at the core of a porphyrin ring. This is what drives photosynthesis.

**Haemoglobin** has Fe²⁺ at the centre of a similar porphyrin called haem. The iron reversibly binds O₂ in the lungs and releases it in tissues.

**Vitamin B₁₂** (cyanocobalamine) is a coordination compound of Co³⁺. Its deficiency causes pernicious anaemia.

Enzymes also use metal coordination. **Carboxypeptidase A** and **carbonic anhydrase** both use coordinated zinc to catalyse biological reactions.

In catalysis, `Wilkinson's catalyst` — [(Ph₃P)₃RhCl] — uses rhodium coordination to hydrogenate alkenes. The alkene and H₂ both coordinate to Rh, bringing them close enough to react.

`Cis-platin` — cis-[PtCl₂(NH₃)₂] — is used in cancer treatment. It binds to DNA in tumour cells and blocks replication. Only the *cis* isomer is active; the trans form doesn't work.

`Chelate therapy` treats metal poisoning by using chelating ligands to grab toxic metal ions and flush them from the body. EDTA removes excess lead. **D-penicillamine** removes excess copper. **Desferrioxime B** removes excess iron.
