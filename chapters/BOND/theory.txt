[BOND_T_001] Why Atoms Bond

Helium, neon, argon — noble gases exist as single atoms. They never react. Every other element forms bonds. What makes noble gases different?

Their outer electron shells are completely full.

@continue

valence-electrons.chem.svg

@continue

Neon has 8 electrons in its outer shell. No room for more, no need to lose any. This filled outer shell — `noble gas configuration` — is extremely stable.

Now look at sodium. Three shells, but the outermost holds just 1 electron. That lone electron makes sodium desperate to react.

@continue

Sodium's second shell has 8 — same as neon. But that doesn't help. It's the outermost shell that decides, and sodium's outermost has just 1.

These outer electrons — the ones involved in bonding — are `valence electrons`. Sodium has 1. Chlorine has 7. Neither is stable alone.

@continue

The pattern: atoms with full outer shells don't react. Atoms with incomplete shells do.

They drive toward 8 outer electrons — the `octet rule`. Hydrogen and helium aim for 2, since their only shell holds 2.

@continue

So atoms bond because isolation is unstable. A `chemical bond` is the attractive force holding atoms together — born from the quest for filled shells.

Two strategies work.

@continue

bonding-strategies.chem.svg

@continue

Transfer: sodium gives its 1 valence electron to chlorine. Sodium's second shell (which has 8) becomes its outer shell. Chlorine goes from 7 to 8. Both stable. That's NaCl — table salt.

@continue

Share: two chlorine atoms each contribute one electron to a shared pair. Each now counts 8 around itself. Both stable. That's Cl₂ — chlorine gas.

Transfer or share — either way, both atoms achieve noble gas configuration. That's the payoff.


[BOND_T_002] Lewis Symbols

How do we show valence electrons on paper? G.N. Lewis devised a simple notation.

Write the element's symbol. Around it, place dots — one for each valence electron. This is the `Lewis symbol`.

@continue

lewis-symbols.chem.svg

@continue

The symbol at center represents the `kernel` — the nucleus plus all inner electrons. Only valence electrons appear as dots.

Let's draw one. Oxygen has 6 valence electrons. Place the first four as singles — one on each side. Two remain. They pair up with existing dots. Result: two pairs and two singles.

@continue

Why singles first? Electrons repel each other. They spread out before doubling up — maximum distance first.

What makes singles special? Each is an unpaired electron — it can pair with an unpaired electron from another atom. That shared pair becomes a bond.

@continue

A pair? Already satisfied — two electrons occupying one spot have no room for a third. Only unpaired electrons are available for bonding.

Now watch what singles predict. Carbon has 4 singles — it forms 4 bonds. That's CH₄. Nitrogen has 3 — NH₃. Oxygen has 2 — H₂O. Fluorine has 1 — HF.

@continue

Neon has 8 dots, all paired. Zero singles. Zero bonds. That's why noble gases don't react — no singles available.

Hydrogen is special. Its only shell holds 2, not 8. It needs just 2 electrons — a `duplet`. Every other main-group element needs 8 — an `octet`.


[BOND_T_003] Electronegativity

Chlorine's Lewis symbol has one single dot — one bond to make. Another chlorine also has one. They pair up. Since both atoms are identical, the shared pair sits exactly in the middle. Fair deal.

Now fluorine shares with hydrogen. Fluorine has 9 protons in its nucleus. Hydrogen has just 1.

@continue

en-drift.chem.svg

@continue

Fluorine pulls on the shared pair much harder. The electrons drift toward fluorine.

This pulling power has a name: `electronegativity`. The higher it is, the harder an atom pulls shared electrons toward itself.

@continue

Linus Pauling gave every element a number. On his `Pauling scale`, fluorine tops the chart at 4.0. Cesium sits at the bottom: 0.7. The trend: top-right of the periodic table pulls hardest, bottom-left pulls weakest.

@continue

The EN difference between two bonded atoms decides the bond type. Zero difference (Cl₂) → electrons shared equally. Moderate difference (HF) → shared but shifted toward fluorine. Huge difference (NaCl, gap of 2.1) → electrons transfer completely.

Equal sharing, unequal sharing, full transfer — electronegativity tells you which.


[BOND_T_004] Ionic Bonding

Sodium has 1 valence electron. Chlorine has 7. Chlorine's electronegativity is so much higher that it doesn't just pull shared electrons closer — it takes sodium's electron entirely.

@continue

Sodium now has 11 protons but only 10 electrons. Net charge: +1. An atom that loses electrons becomes positive — a `cation`. Na⁺ is a cation.

Chlorine now has 17 protons but 18 electrons. Net charge: −1. An atom that gains electrons becomes negative — an `anion`. Cl⁻ is an anion.

@continue

Opposite charges attract. This electrostatic pull between cation and anion is an `ionic bond`, also called an `electrovalent bond`.

How many electrons did sodium transfer? One. This count is the `electrovalence`. Sodium's electrovalence: +1. Chlorine's: −1.

@continue

Now magnesium and oxygen. Magnesium has 2 valence electrons. Oxygen has 6 — needs 2 more for an octet. Magnesium transfers both.

@continue

mgo-ionic.chem.svg

@continue

Mg²⁺ (cation, electrovalence +2) and O²⁻ (anion, electrovalence −2). Both achieve octets through a double transfer.

Metals lose electrons → cations. Nonmetals gain electrons → anions. The electrostatic force between them is ionic bonding.


[BOND_T_005] Energetics of Ionic Compounds

Making NaCl looks simple — sodium gives an electron to chlorine, both get octets, done. But pulling that electron off sodium costs energy. Does the transfer actually pay off?

Let's keep a ledger.

@continue

Sodium has 11 protons gripping its outer electron. Ripping it away costs 495.8 kJ/mol. This energy cost is `ionization enthalpy` — always endothermic, because you're always fighting nuclear pull.

@continue

Now hand that electron to chlorine. Chlorine has 17 protons and room for one more. The nucleus pulls it in, releasing 348.7 kJ/mol. This energy change is `electron gain enthalpy`.

Ledger so far: spent 495.8, recovered 348.7. Net loss: 147.1 kJ/mol. Still in the red.

@continue

By this math, NaCl shouldn't exist.

Yet oceans are salty.

@continue

Na⁺ and Cl⁻ don't float around as lonely ions. Billions snap into a tight repeating 3D grid — every Na⁺ surrounded by Cl⁻, every Cl⁻ by Na⁺. This arrangement is a `crystal lattice`.

@continue

nacl-lattice.webp

@continue

Packing ions this tightly releases 788 kJ/mol. The energy needed to completely separate one mole of ionic solid into gaseous ions is the `lattice enthalpy`.

Redo the ledger. Spent 495.8, recovered 348.7, then recovered 788. The lattice wipes out the deficit and leaves a huge surplus.

@continue

Octets explain *which* electron transfers happen. Lattice enthalpy explains *why* the compound forms at all.

An older term, `electron affinity`, has the same magnitude as electron gain enthalpy but opposite sign.


[BOND_T_006] Fajans' Rules

Picture a tiny Li⁺ sitting next to a large I⁻. Li⁺ packs its positive charge into a very small sphere — intense electric field at the surface.

I⁻'s outermost electrons sit far from its nucleus, loosely held. Li⁺'s field reaches in and pulls the electron cloud toward itself.

@continue

The cloud stretches. Bulges toward the cation. Electron density piles up between the two nuclei.

@continue

polarization.webp

@continue

This distortion of an anion's electron cloud by a cation is `polarization`. That pile-up between nuclei is shared electron density — covalent character creeping into an ionic bond.

Two properties control how much this happens. The cation's `polarising power` is its ability to distort. The anion's `polarisability` is how easily its cloud gives way.

@continue

A smaller cation concentrates charge into less space — stronger pull. Compare LiCl with KCl: Li⁺ is much smaller, so it distorts Cl⁻ more. LiCl has more covalent character.

@continue

A larger anion has outer electrons far from the nucleus — easy to pull. Compare NaF with NaI: I⁻ is much bigger than F⁻, so Na⁺ distorts it more easily.

@continue

Higher charge means stronger field. Compare NaCl with AlCl₃. Al³⁺ is +3 and tiny — it polarizes Cl⁻ so strongly that AlCl₃ behaves like a covalent compound.

@continue

One more factor. Compare Cu²⁺ with Ca²⁺ — same +2 charge, similar size. Yet Cu²⁺ polarizes more. Ca²⁺ has a noble gas core — inner shells shield well. Cu²⁺ has d-electrons that shield poorly, so more nuclear charge leaks through.

@continue

fajans-comparison.webp

@continue

These patterns are `Fajans' rules`. Small cation, large anion, high charge, d-electron configuration — each pushes a bond from ionic toward covalent.


[BOND_T_007] Covalent Bonding

Some atoms grip electrons too tightly for transfer. Two chlorine atoms each need one more electron for an octet. But neither will surrender one.

So they share. Each chlorine puts its one unpaired electron into a common space between them. That shared pair now sits between both nuclei.

@continue

Both nuclei attract those two electrons. So each chlorine counts the shared pair as its own — along with the 6 electrons (three pairs) it kept. That's 8 each. Full octet.

The shared pair holding two atoms together is a `bonding pair`. A bond formed by sharing rather than transferring is a `covalent bond`. Each atom must contribute at least one electron to the pair.

@continue

The three unshared pairs on each chlorine aren't involved in bonding. These are `lone pairs` (also called non-bonding pairs). They belong to one atom alone.

covalent-bond.chem.svg

@continue

Water works the same way. Oxygen has 6 valence electrons — two unpaired. Each hydrogen has 1. Oxygen shares one unpaired electron with each H. Two bonding pairs form, and oxygen keeps its remaining 4 electrons as two lone pairs.

@continue

Now a bigger molecule: CCl₄. Carbon has 4 unpaired valence electrons. Each chlorine has 1. Carbon shares one electron with each of four chlorines — four bonding pairs. Every atom reaches an octet.

Covalent bonds show up most between nonmetals. These atoms all grip electrons tightly — similar pull, so neither can take from the other. Sharing is the only way both come out ahead.


[BOND_T_NEW] Coordinate (Dative) Bond

In a covalent bond, each atom puts one electron into the shared pair. But what if one atom has no unpaired electron to offer?

@continue

Boron in BF₃ has 3 valence electrons. One bond to each fluorine uses all 3. Count electrons around boron: only 6. It wants 8 but has nothing left to share.

Now look at nitrogen in NH₃. Three bonds use 3 of its 5 valence electrons. The remaining 2 sit as a lone pair — belonging to nitrogen alone.

@continue

Boron has an empty orbital. Nitrogen has a full lone pair. One atom needs electrons, the other has a spare pair.

Nitrogen donates its entire lone pair into boron's empty orbital. Both electrons come from nitrogen. Boron just provides the empty space.

@continue

coordinate-bond-nh3bf3.chem.svg

@continue

This is a `coordinate bond` (also called a `dative bond`). Both shared electrons come from one atom — the `donor`. The other atom provides an empty orbital — the `acceptor`.

We show it with an arrow → from donor to acceptor.

@continue

Count boron's electrons now. Three bonds from fluorine, plus the donated pair. That's 8. Nitrogen keeps its octet too — three N–H bonds plus the pair it donated.

Both atoms reach a full octet. The donation completes boron's shell without breaking nitrogen's.

@continue

The same idea explains NH₄⁺. Ammonia has that same lone pair on nitrogen. H⁺ has no electrons at all — its 1s orbital is completely empty.

Nitrogen donates its lone pair into the empty 1s of H⁺. A **coordinate bond** forms.

@continue

Here's the key fact. Once formed, a coordinate bond is identical to any other covalent bond. Same length, same strength. You can't tell which electron came from where.

In NH₄⁺, all four N–H bonds end up equal. The one that formed by donation is no different from the three that formed by normal sharing.

The arrow notation (→) just records how the bond formed. It says nothing about the bond's current properties.



[BOND_T_008] Single, Double, and Triple Bonds

Fluorine has 7 valence electrons — three pairs and one unpaired. Two fluorine atoms each put their unpaired electron into a shared pair. One shared pair: a `single bond`.

Oxygen has 6 valence electrons — two pairs and two unpaired. Two oxygens share both unpaired electrons. Two shared pairs make a `double bond`.

@continue

Now predict. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons — one pair and three unpaired. Two nitrogens meet. How many pairs will they share?

Three. That's a `triple bond` — six electrons binding two atoms together.

@continue

bond-multiplicity.chem.svg

@continue

More shared pairs means more electron density between the two nuclei — a stronger tug pulling them together. Triple bonds are stronger than double, double stronger than single.

That stronger pull also drags nuclei closer. F–F is 142 pm. O=O shrinks to 121 pm. N≡N is just 109 pm.

The number of shared pairs between two atoms is the `bond order`. Single: 1. Double: 2. Triple: 3. Higher bond order → shorter and stronger bonds.


[BOND_T_009] Drawing Lewis Structures

CO₂ has 16 valence electrons — 4 from carbon, 6 from each oxygen. Where does each one end up?

The `central atom` forms the most bonds, so it should be the one that shares most willingly — the least electronegative. Carbon is less electronegative than oxygen, so carbon goes in the middle.

@continue

The oxygens are `terminal atoms` — they sit on the outside. Hydrogen can only form one bond (it just needs a duplet), so it's always terminal.

Connect each terminal to the center with a single bond: O–C–O. This starting framework is the `skeletal structure`. Two bonds use 4 electrons. Twelve remain.

@continue

Now fill octets on the outer atoms first — they're more electronegative, so their octets take priority. Each oxygen gets three lone pairs (6 electrons). All 12 placed.

Check the center. Each oxygen has 2 + 6 = 8 electrons — good. But carbon has just 4 from its two bonds. It needs 8.

@continue

All 16 electrons are already placed — you can't add new ones. The only fix: take a lone pair from a terminal oxygen and share it as a bonding pair with carbon.

Do this on both sides. Each single bond becomes a double bond. O=C=O.

@continue

lewis-steps.chem.svg

@continue

Carbon now has four bonding pairs — 8 electrons. Both oxygens still have 8 (two bonding pairs + two lone pairs). All 16 accounted for.

Not every molecule needs that fix. In H₂O, after placing lone pairs on oxygen, the central atom already has its octet. Done — no conversion needed.

@continue

For ions, adjust the electron count before you start. CO₃²⁻ has two extra electrons: 4 + 18 + 2 = 24. NH₄⁺ has one fewer: 5 + 4 − 1 = 8. Then follow the same steps.


[BOND_T_010] Formal Charge

Look closely at ozone's Lewis structure — one O=O double bond, one O–O single bond. Each atom shares electrons, but sharing isn't always even. Let's count what each oxygen actually "owns."

Start with the central oxygen. It has one lone pair — 2 electrons it owns outright. It also has three bonds. Split each bonding pair 50-50: that gives it 3 more. Total owned: 5.

A free oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. Central oxygen brought 6, owns 5 — that deficit of +1 is its `formal charge`.

@continue

Double-bonded end oxygen: two lone pairs (4) plus two bonds (2). Owns 6. Brought 6. Formal charge: 0.

Single-bonded end oxygen: three lone pairs (6) plus one bond (1). Owns 7. Brought 6. Formal charge: −1.

@continue

ozone-formal-charge.chem.svg

@continue

Check: +1 + 0 + (−1) = 0. Matches ozone's net charge. For any ion, formal charges sum to the ion's charge instead.

The pattern: formal charge = valence electrons − lone pair electrons − ½(bonding electrons). "Valence electrons" is what the atom brought. The rest is what it owns.

@continue

When multiple Lewis structures are possible, formal charges pick the lowest-energy arrangement. Large formal charges force atoms into unlikely electron distributions — that costs energy. The best structure has the smallest charges.

If charges can't be avoided, place negatives on the more electronegative atom — it holds extra electrons more stably.

Formal charges are pure bookkeeping — not real. No instrument measures +1 on ozone's central oxygen. They rank Lewis structures, nothing more.


[BOND_T_011] Limitations of Octet Rule

The octet rule predicts 8 electrons around every atom. It works for most molecules — especially organic compounds with C, N, O, F. But some compounds refuse to comply.

BF₃: boron has only 3 valence electrons. It forms one bond with each fluorine — three bonding pairs. Count the electrons around boron: just 6. Not 8.

Boron can't reach an octet. It doesn't have enough valence electrons. Fluorine is too electronegative to share a lone pair back. BeH₂ is worse — only 4 around beryllium. This is an `incomplete octet`.

@continue

Now NO. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, oxygen has 6. Total: 11. An odd number. Electrons pair in twos, so one must stay unpaired no matter how you arrange them.

NO₂ has the same issue — 17 total electrons. Odd means one electron has no partner. These are `odd-electron molecules`.

@continue

PCl₅ goes the other direction. Phosphorus bonds to five chlorines — 10 electrons around it. More than 8. SF₆ pushes to 12 around sulfur.

How? Both sit in period 3. Beyond their 3s and 3p orbitals, they have empty 3d orbitals that accept extra bonding electrons. This is an `expanded octet`.

@continue

octet-exceptions.chem.svg

@continue

But expanding is a choice, not a requirement. Sulphur in SCl₂ obeys the octet with just 8 electrons around it. Period 3 elements can expand — they don't have to.

Here's the critical line. Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine — all period 2 — have no d orbitals. They can never exceed 8. Only period 3 and beyond can expand.

That's why NCl₅ doesn't exist even though PCl₅ does. Same group, same valence electrons — but nitrogen lacks the d orbitals to hold 10.

The octet rule has other gaps too. Xenon forms XeF₂ — it uses its 5d orbitals, the same expanded octet pattern. And the rule says nothing about molecular shapes or relative stability.


[BOND_T_012] Resonance

Ozone's Lewis structure has one double bond and one single bond. The drawing predicts two different bond lengths.

ozone-clash.webp

@continue

Experiments say both are 128 pm — identical. Something's wrong with our Lewis structure.

Not because we drew it wrong — because no single Lewis structure CAN capture this molecule.

@continue

resonance-ozone.chem.svg

@continue

There's a second valid structure. Same atoms, same electrons — just flip which oxygen gets the double bond. Both follow the rules. Neither matches reality alone.

@continue

Why would a molecule adopt a blend of both? Spreading electron density over more atoms means more nuclei pull on it. That lowers the overall energy. The blend is more stable than either single structure.

@continue

Think of a mule. It's not a horse sometimes and a donkey other times — it's always a mule. A blend of both parents, where neither parent is the *real* form.

@continue

Same idea here. Each valid drawing is a `canonical structure` — correct on paper but not a real molecule. The real molecule is the `resonance hybrid`, a blend of all canonical forms. This blending is `resonance`.

The ↔ between canonical structures is not an equilibrium arrow (⇌). The molecule doesn't switch between forms. It's always the hybrid.

For valid canonical forms: same atom positions, same total electrons. Only bonds and lone pairs rearrange. If atoms move, that's a different molecule — not resonance.

@continue

resonance-carbonate.chem.svg

@continue

CO₃²⁻ shows the same pattern. Three canonical structures, each with the double bond on a different oxygen. All three C–O bonds end up identical — intermediate between single and double.

CO₂ also has two equivalent canonical forms.

@continue

The hybrid averages all bond characteristics — length, strength, bond order. This extra stability from blending is called `resonance stabilization`.


[BOND_T_013] Bond Length and Atomic Radii

The same chlorine atom has two different sizes. How can one atom have two radii?

cl2-radii.chem.svg

@continue

In Cl₂, each Cl contributes 99 pm to the bond. Unbonded, it keeps other atoms 180 pm away — nearly double.

Shared electrons tug two nuclei together, pulling bonded atoms closer than they'd otherwise sit.

`Bond length` is the equilibrium distance between two bonded nuclei — where attraction and repulsion balance. In Cl₂, that's 199 pm. We measure it using X-ray diffraction or spectroscopy.

@continue

Each atom contributes a `covalent radius` to the bond length. It's half the distance between two identical bonded atoms. Chlorine's: 99 pm.

The larger size is the `van der Waals radius` — half the distance between two unbonded atoms touching in a solid. Chlorine's: 180 pm.

Van der Waals radius is always larger than covalent radius. Bonding pulls atoms closer than they'd otherwise sit.


[BOND_T_014] Bond Angle and Bond Order

Water is V-shaped. Methane is a tetrahedron. BeCl₂ is a straight line. You can tell these apart from a single number — the angle between two bonds.

H–O–H in water: 104.5°. H–C–H in methane: 109.5°. Cl–Be–Cl: 180°.

This angle — between the orbitals holding bonding electron pairs around a central atom — is the `bond angle`. 180° means linear. 120° means trigonal planar. 109.5° signals tetrahedral.

bond-angle-shapes.chem.svg

@continue

Now a different question. F–F is easy to break. N≡N is nearly indestructible. Why?

Count the shared pairs. F₂ shares one pair — a single bond. N₂ shares three — a triple bond. Three times the glue.

The number of shared pairs between two atoms is the `bond order`. Single = 1. Double = 2. Triple = 3. CO has a triple bond, so bond order 3 — same as N₂.

@continue

Higher bond order means shorter, stronger bonds. Each extra shared pair pulls nuclei closer. Look at carbon–carbon: C–C is 154 pm, C=C shrinks to 134 pm, C≡C compresses to 120 pm.

Some different species have the same total electron count and bonding arrangement. N₂ and CO both have 14 electrons arranged identically. They're `isoelectronic`.

Isoelectronic species share the same bond order. F₂ and O₂²⁻ both have bond order 1. N₂, CO, and NO⁺ all have bond order 3.


[BOND_T_015] Bond Enthalpy

Breaking bonds costs energy. Why? Because bonded atoms sit at lower energy than separated atoms — you must add energy to pull them apart.

But here's a puzzle — water's two O-H bonds don't cost the same to break.

water-bond-break.webp

@continue

The first O-H bond takes 502 kJ/mol. The second takes only 427 kJ/mol. Same type of bond, different energy.

Why? After the first hydrogen leaves, you're breaking an O-H bond in OH — a different species with a different electron arrangement around oxygen. That changes how tightly the remaining H is held.

`Bond enthalpy` (or `bond dissociation enthalpy`) is the energy needed to break one mole of a particular bond in gaseous molecules, producing gaseous atoms. Larger bond enthalpy means a stronger bond.

@continue

For diatomic molecules, bond enthalpy is exact. H–H: 435.8 kJ/mol. Cl–Cl: 242 kJ/mol. H–Cl: 431 kJ/mol. O=O: 498 kJ/mol. N≡N: 946 kJ/mol. One bond, one value.

Higher bond order means higher bond enthalpy. Triple bonds cost the most to break.

@continue

Polyatomic molecules are messy — like water. The same O-H bond even differs between water and ethanol, because the surrounding atoms change.

So we average. `Mean bond enthalpy` is the total energy to break all bonds of one type, divided by the number of those bonds.

For O-H in water: (502 + 427)/2 = 464.5 kJ/mol.

Mean bond enthalpies let us estimate reaction energies: energy to break reactant bonds minus energy released forming product bonds.


[BOND_T_016] Polar and Nonpolar Bonds

Compare two molecules — H₂ and HF. Both share electrons. But look at *where* the shared electrons sit.

polar-vs-nonpolar.webp

In H₂, the electron cloud is perfectly centered. In HF, it's bunched up near fluorine.

@continue

Think of a tug of war. If both players pull equally, the rope stays in the middle. If one is stronger, the rope shifts.

**Electronegativity** is that pulling strength. In H₂, both atoms pull equally. The shared pair stays midway. No atom wins.

In HF, fluorine pulls much harder. The electron pair shifts toward it. Fluorine becomes slightly negative (δ−). Hydrogen becomes slightly positive (δ+).

@continue

Equal sharing — like in H₂, Cl₂, O₂ — is a `nonpolar covalent` bond. Symmetric cloud. No charge imbalance.

Unequal sharing — like in HF — is a `polar covalent` bond. The cloud tilts. One end gets δ−, the other δ+.

The bigger the electronegativity gap, the more the cloud tilts. HF is very polar. HCl, less so.

@continue

When does polar covalent become **ionic**? There's no sharp line. If the gap is huge — like NaCl — the electron transfers almost completely.

But even NaCl isn't purely ionic. The cation's pull distorts the anion's cloud, introducing `partial covalent character`. That's the **polarisation** effect from Fajans' rules.

And even HF isn't purely covalent. The charge separation gives it `partial ionic character`.

Bonds sit on a spectrum. Pure covalent (H₂) → polar covalent (HF) → mostly ionic (NaCl). The electronegativity difference decides where a bond falls.


[BOND_T_017] Dipole Moment

CO₂ has two polar C=O bonds — oxygen pulls electrons harder than carbon. Yet CO₂ behaves nonpolar. How?

Picture the molecule. Carbon sits in the middle, one oxygen on each side. Linear. The left oxygen pulls electrons left. The right pulls right. Equal, opposite — they cancel perfectly.

@continue

Water also has two polar bonds. But the molecule is V-shaped. Both O-H pulls point roughly the same way — toward the oxygen. They add up instead of canceling.

Same idea, different shapes, opposite outcomes. Shape decides whether bond pulls cancel or combine.

@continue

Each polar bond creates a `bond dipole` — a tug in one direction. The molecule's overall polarity is the sum of all its bond dipoles. That sum is the `resultant dipole moment`.

We measure polarity with `dipole moment` (μ). It's a vector — direction matters as much as size.

The formula: μ = Q × r, where Q is the separated charge and r is the distance between charges.

The unit is the `Debye` (D). 1 D = 3.33564 × 10⁻³⁰ C·m.

@continue

By convention, the dipole moment vector points from negative to positive.

But chemists use a different symbol — a crossed arrow. The cross (+) sits on the positive end, the arrowhead on the negative end.

The crossed arrow points opposite to the conventional dipole moment vector. Don't mix them up.

@continue

For single-bond molecules, bigger electronegativity gap means bigger dipole. HF: 1.78 D. HCl: 1.07 D. HBr: 0.79 D. HI: 0.38 D.

Back to shape. BeF₂ is linear — two bond dipoles cancel, μ = 0. BF₃ is a flat triangle — three dipoles cancel, μ = 0.

CCl₄ has four bonds equally spaced — they cancel too, μ = 0.

Symmetry kills polarity. Water (V-shaped, μ = 1.85 D) shows what happens when symmetry breaks.

@continue

Now a puzzle. NH₃ and NF₃ are both pyramidal. Fluorine is far more electronegative than hydrogen. Surely NF₃ has the bigger dipole?

nh3-nf3-dipole.chem.svg

@continue

Wrong. NH₃: μ = 1.47 D. NF₃: only 0.23 D.

The lone pair on nitrogen creates its own dipole — the `orbital dipole`. It points outward from the top of the pyramid.

In NH₃, bond dipoles point toward nitrogen (upward). The orbital dipole also points upward. Same direction — they reinforce. Large μ.

In NF₃, bond dipoles point toward fluorine (downward). The orbital dipole still points upward. Opposite directions — they largely cancel. Small μ.

Same shape, opposite outcomes. The orbital dipole from the lone pair decides whether bond dipoles reinforce or fight each other.


[BOND_T_018] VSEPR Theory: Core Idea

What shape do electron pairs make when they push each other away? Start with something simpler — balloons.

vsepr-balloons.webp

Blow up two balloons and tie them together. They push apart — opposite directions, 180°. Three balloons spread into a triangle, 120° apart. Four make a pyramid, 109.5° apart.

The balloons take up space. They push each other away and settle as far apart as possible.

@continue

Electron pairs do the same thing. Picture the valence shell as a sphere. Electron pairs sit on its surface, pushing apart until they reach maximum separation.

This is `Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion` — **VSEPR** theory. Sidgwick and Powell saw this pattern in 1940. Nyholm and Gillespie refined it in 1957 into a model that predicts molecular shapes.

@continue

Both bonding pairs and lone pairs count. But they're not the same size.

A bonding pair is shared between two nuclei — pulled tight into the bond region. A lone pair belongs to just one atom — it spreads wider, like a passenger taking up extra space on a bus seat.

That wider spread means stronger repulsion. Lone pair–lone pair is the strongest push. Lone pair–bonding pair is medium. Bonding pair–bonding pair is weakest.

The order: lp–lp > lp–bp > bp–bp.

@continue

Double and triple bonds count as one "super pair." All those electrons sit in the same region, pushing other pairs as a single unit.

For molecules with resonance structures, pick any one form. The geometry stays the same — the number of electron pair regions doesn't change between resonance forms.

Count electron pairs. Let them maximize distance. Shape follows.


[BOND_T_019] VSEPR: Shapes Without Lone Pairs

When a central atom has only bonding pairs — no lone pairs — five shapes cover every case.

vsepr-shapes.webp

Each follows from one rule: pairs spread as far apart as possible.

@continue

Two bonds push to opposite sides. The angle is 180°. A straight line — `linear`. BeCl₂ shows this. Two chlorines, as far apart as they can get.

Three bonds spread into a flat triangle. Each sits 120° from its neighbors. This is `trigonal planar`. BF₃ has this shape — three fluorines around boron.

@continue

Four bonds can't stay flat. If they did, the best they'd manage is 90° apart. Going 3D lets them reach 109.5° — much wider, much less repulsion.

This shape is `tetrahedral`. CH₄ has four hydrogens around carbon, all equally spaced.

Five bonds create `trigonal bipyramidal`. Here, positions aren't equal anymore.

Three bonds sit in the middle plane, 120° apart — the `equatorial` positions. Two bonds sit above and below, 90° from the middle three — the `axial` positions.

PCl₅ has this shape. Axial bonds face more crowding from three equatorial neighbors, so they end up slightly longer.

@continue

Six bonds spread to an `octahedral` shape. Four form a square in the middle. Two more point straight up and down. All angles are 90°. SF₆ has this — six fluorines equally spaced around sulfur.

These five shapes cover every case where the central atom has no lone pairs. But what happens when lone pairs show up? They push harder than bonding pairs — and that changes everything.


[BOND_T_020] VSEPR: Shapes With Lone Pairs (Part 1)

You know methane — four bonds around carbon, tetrahedral, 109.5°. Now imagine swapping one hydrogen for a lone pair.

The four electron pairs still arrange tetrahedrally. But when we describe the molecular shape, we only count where atoms sit. Lone pairs are invisible.

lp-shape-progression.webp

@continue

Three bonds plus one lone pair. The three atoms form a pyramid. This shape is `trigonal pyramidal`. NH₃ and PCl₃ look like this.

The lone pair takes up more space than a bond. It pushes the three N-H bonds closer. The angle squeezes from 109.5° down to 107°.

@continue

Now swap a second bond for another lone pair. Two bonds, two lone pairs — still four pairs arranged tetrahedrally.

But the shape you see is `bent` — a V. Water (H₂O) and SCl₂ are bent. Two lone pairs squeeze the angle further — down to 104.5°.

The pattern in the numbers: 109.5° → 107° → 104.5°. Each lone pair added squeezes the bonds tighter.

@continue

There's another way to get a bent shape. Start with trigonal planar — three electron pairs at 120°. Replace one bond with a lone pair.

Two bonds remain with one lone pair. Still bent, but the angle is about 120° (slightly less). SnCl₂ and SO₂ have this shape.

Same name — bent — but different angles. One comes from a tetrahedral parent (~104.5°). The other from a trigonal planar parent (~120°). The parent geometry decides the angle.

The rule: count ALL electron pairs to find the arrangement. Then ignore the lone pairs — what's left is the shape.


[BOND_T_021] VSEPR: Shapes With Lone Pairs (Part 2)

Now the bigger parents — five and six electron pairs. Same logic: lone pairs are invisible, but they pick the roomiest seat.

In a trigonal bipyramidal parent, not all positions are equal. **Equatorial** spots face only two neighbors at 90°. **Axial** spots face three at 90°.

Lone pairs want the most room. So they always grab equatorial spots first — fewer close neighbors, less repulsion.

tbp-lone-pairs.webp

@continue

SF₄ has four bonds and one lone pair. The lone pair takes an equatorial spot. The four fluorines tilt around it — a `see-saw` shape.

Add a second lone pair. ClF₃ and BrF₃ have three bonds, two lone pairs. Both lone pairs sit equatorial. Three bonds are forced into a `T-shaped` arrangement.

Third lone pair. XeF₂ and I₃⁻ have two bonds, three lone pairs. All three lone pairs fill the equatorial plane.

Only the two axial bonds remain — straight up and down. Linear again, but from a five-pair parent.

@continue

Now the octahedral parent — six electron pairs, all positions equal.

BrF₅ and IF₅ have five bonds and one lone pair. The lone pair takes one spot. Five bonds form a `square pyramidal` shape — four in a square, one on top.

@continue

XeF₄ has four bonds and two lone pairs. Where do the two lone pairs go? Opposite each other — 180° apart. Next to each other would mean 90° between them, too much repulsion.

With lone pairs above and below, the four fluorines sit in a flat square. This is `square planar`.

The logic is the same everywhere. Lone pairs grab the roomiest spots. Count what's left — that's the shape you see.


[BOND_T_022] Three Bonding Theories

**Lewis structures** show which atoms connect and where electrons sit. Fast, useful — but limited.

Why does breaking H₂ need 436 kJ/mol while F₂ needs only 155? Lewis can't explain bond strengths.

**VSEPR** predicts shapes — water is bent, methane is tetrahedral. It works well. But it only describes a pattern: pairs repel, so they spread apart.

VSEPR never explains *how* atoms rearrange their orbitals to bond. It says "tetrahedral" but not *why* four identical bonds form from different-looking orbitals.

Think of bonding theories as a toolkit. Each tool goes deeper than the last.

@continue

`Valence bond theory` (VBT) explains the mechanism behind those shapes. When atomic orbitals from two atoms overlap, electrons pair up in the overlap zone.

More overlap → stronger bond. This is why H–H is stronger than F–F. VBT connects shape to actual orbital behaviour.

VBT also reveals two kinds of overlap: head-on (sigma) and sideways (pi). VSEPR can't tell you this — it doesn't look at orbitals at all.

VSEPR spots the pattern. VBT shows the machinery underneath.

@continue

But VBT has its own blind spot. It says electrons belong to specific atom pairs.

Oxygen gas (O₂) is attracted to magnets — it's **paramagnetic**. VBT predicts all electrons in O₂ are paired, so no magnetism. The model breaks here.

`Molecular orbital theory` (MOT) fixes this. Instead of electrons staying between two atoms, MOT spreads them across the whole molecule. This explains what VBT misses.

Lewis for quick sketches. VSEPR for shapes. VBT for why bonds form and how strong they are. MOT for the complete picture. Each layer adds something the previous one can't.


[BOND_T_023] Valence Bond Theory: Orbital Overlap

Two hydrogen atoms, far apart. Each has one proton and one electron. At this distance, they don't feel each other. Energy: zero.

Now bring them closer. Four new forces appear.

@continue

four-forces-h2.chem.svg

@continue

Two attractions: nucleus A pulls electron B toward it. Nucleus B pulls electron A toward it. Each proton reaches across to grab the other atom's electron.

Two repulsions: electron A and electron B push each other away (both negative). Nucleus A and nucleus B push each other away (both positive).

@continue

Far apart — all four forces are tiny. Nothing happens. Energy stays flat.

@continue

Moving closer — the electrons drift between the two nuclei. Both protons pull on both electrons. The cross-attractions grow strong.

Repulsions grow too, but slower. The electrons sit between the nuclei, shielding one proton from the other.

Attractions win. Energy drops.

@continue

Too close — the nuclei are nearly on top of each other. Two positive charges crammed together. Nuclear repulsion spikes sharply. No amount of electron shielding can overcome it.

Energy shoots back up.

@continue

h2-energy-curve.chem.svg

@continue

The curve drops, hits a minimum, then rises. That lowest point is where attractions and repulsions perfectly balance.

For H₂, this sweet spot is at 74 pm. The energy drop from separated atoms to this point is 435.8 kJ/mol — the **bond enthalpy**.

@continue

Now look at what's physically happening at 74 pm. The 1s orbitals of the two atoms partially merge. Electron density piles up in the region between the nuclei.

This partial merging is `orbital overlap`. Not just "sharing electrons" in some vague way — there's a real zone where electrons spend most of their time, and both nuclei are pulled toward it.

@continue

Greater overlap means more electron density between nuclei. Stronger pull. Deeper energy well. Stronger bond.

Every covalent bond follows this pattern: approach, overlap, energy minimum. The atoms change, but the logic stays the same.


[BOND_T_024] Sigma Bonds

When two orbitals overlap head-on — directly along the line joining the nuclei — they form a `sigma bond` (σ bond). The electron density piles up right between the nuclei.

sigma-overlaps.chem.svg

@continue

Three combinations can make a sigma bond, same idea each time.

Two s orbitals meet head-on — that's s-s overlap. H₂ forms this way.

An s orbital meets one lobe of a p orbital end-to-end — s-p overlap. HCl forms this way. Hydrogen's 1s overlaps with chlorine's 3p.

Two p orbitals point straight at each other — p-p overlap. F₂ forms this way.

@continue

Different orbitals, same result: head-on overlap (also called `axial overlap`) along the bond axis. The electron cloud is symmetric around this axis — rotate the bond and it looks the same.

Sigma bonds are strong because head-on overlap is the most overlap you can get. Every single bond is a sigma bond.

Double and triple bonds also have one sigma bond inside them. The sigma forms first. Other bonds add on top.


[BOND_T_025] Pi Bonds

Ethylene (C₂H₄) is flat. You can't twist one CH₂ group around the C=C bond. Try to rotate them, and the molecule resists. Why is the double bond so rigid?

Because there's a second bond — not another sigma, but a `pi bond` (π bond). It forms from `sidewise overlap` of p orbitals.

@continue

In sigma bonds, orbitals meet head-on. In pi bonds, parallel p orbitals overlap sideways. The electron cloud sits above and below the bond axis, not between the nuclei.

sigma-vs-pi.chem.svg

@continue

This sideways overlap is smaller than head-on. Less overlap means a weaker bond. Pi bonds are weaker than sigma bonds.

But pi bonds lock rotation. If you twist one atom, the parallel p orbitals tilt apart and the overlap breaks. That's why double bonds are rigid.

@continue

A double bond = one sigma + one pi (1σ + 1π). A triple bond = one sigma + two pi (1σ + 2π).

Pi bonds never exist alone. The sigma bond forms first, bringing atoms close enough for the p orbitals to line up sideways. Only then can pi bonding happen.


[BOND_T_026] Why Hybridisation?

Carbon's ground state is 1s² 2s² 2p². Only 2 unpaired electrons sit in the 2p orbitals. So carbon should form just 2 bonds. But methane has 4.

Promotion fixes the count. One 2s electron jumps to the empty 2p orbital. Now carbon has 4 unpaired electrons — one in 2s, three in 2p. Four bonds become possible.

But these four orbitals aren't the same. The 2s orbital is spherical. The three 2p orbitals point at right angles to each other.

@continue

If hydrogen's 1s overlaps with these pure orbitals, we'd get 3 bonds at 90° from the p orbitals. The fourth — from the spherical s — could point in any direction.

Real methane looks nothing like this. All 4 C–H bonds are identical — same length, same strength — at 109.5° apart. Tetrahedral.

The same problem shows up in NH₃ and H₂O. Pure p orbital overlap predicts 90° angles. Actual angles: 107° and 104.5°.

@continue

Promotion fixed the count. It didn't fix the shape. Pure atomic orbitals can't explain any of these molecules. Something must change before bonding happens.

Think about what each orbital offers for bonding.

@continue

An s orbital is a sphere. It spreads equally in all directions. When another atom approaches from one side, most of the s orbital is elsewhere. Poor overlap.

A p orbital is directional — good. But it has two equal lobes pointing opposite ways. Only one lobe faces the bonding partner. The other lobe is wasted.

@continue

What if an atom could build a better orbital? One with a single fat lobe aimed right at its bonding partner and just a tiny lobe behind?

More of the orbital would sit in the overlap zone. More overlap means a stronger bond. Stronger bonds release more energy. The molecule ends up more stable.

@continue

Atoms do exactly this. They mix their s and p orbitals into new shapes — `hybrid orbitals`. This mixing is `hybridisation`.

The s orbital's reach in all directions combines with the p orbital's concentration along one axis. The result: a hybrid with one large lobe that overlaps far better than either parent.

@continue

For methane: one 2s and three 2p orbitals mix into four **sp³** hybrids. Each has 25% s-character and 75% p-character. All four are identical in energy and shape.

carbon-hybridisation-stages.chem.svg

@continue

These four sp³ hybrids point toward the corners of a tetrahedron — 109.5° apart. Each overlaps head-on with hydrogen's 1s, forming a sigma bond. All four C–H bonds come out identical. Problem solved.

Hybrids also spread apart to reduce repulsion between electron pairs. The type of hybridisation directly tells you the geometry.

@continue

The number of hybrids out always equals the number of atomic orbitals in. Four orbitals mixed, four hybrids formed. Every hybrid in a set is identical — same energy, same shape.

A few rules. Only valence shell orbitals mix — inner shells stay untouched. The mixing orbitals must have similar energies — 2s and 2p can mix, but 1s and 2p cannot.

Promotion is not required before hybridisation. And even completely filled orbitals can take part — not just half-filled ones.


[BOND_T_027] sp Hybridisation

Beryllium's ground state is 1s² 2s². Count the unpaired electrons: zero. Beryllium shouldn't form any bonds at all.

Yet BeCl₂ exists. And it's perfectly linear — two identical Be–Cl bonds at exactly 180°. How?

First, promotion. One 2s electron jumps to the empty 2p orbital. Now beryllium has two unpaired electrons — one in 2s, one in 2p. Two bonds become possible.

@continue

But 2s is spherical and 2p points along one axis. They're different shapes with different energies. Two bonds from these orbitals wouldn't be identical.

So they mix. One s + one p blend into two equivalent `sp hybrid` orbitals. This is `sp hybridisation`, also called `diagonal hybridisation`.

Each sp hybrid has 50% s-character and 50% p-character. Equal in energy, equal in shape.

@continue

The shape: a dumbbell with one lobe much bigger than the other. The big lobe points forward — that's the bonding end. A tiny lobe sits behind it. The big lobe overlaps better, forming stronger bonds.

The two sp hybrids point in opposite directions along the z-axis — 180° apart. Maximum distance between them.

sp-hybrid-formation.chem.svg

@continue

Each hybrid overlaps head-on with a half-filled p orbital on chlorine, forming a sigma bond. Two sigma bonds, perfectly linear. That's BeCl₂.

Ethyne (C₂H₂) uses sp hybridisation too. Each carbon forms two sp hybrids for sigma bonds — one to hydrogen, one to the other carbon.

Two unhybridised p orbitals (2pₓ and 2pᵧ) remain on each carbon. They overlap sideways to form two pi bonds, giving the C≡C triple bond.

The pattern: sp hybridisation → 2 hybrid orbitals → 180° → linear geometry.


[BOND_T_028] sp² Hybridisation

Boron's ground state is 1s² 2s² 2p¹. Only one unpaired electron. One bond is all boron should manage.

But BCl₃ exists — three identical B–Cl bonds, all in one flat plane at 120°. Something doesn't add up.

Promotion helps. One 2s electron jumps to an empty 2p orbital. Now boron has three unpaired electrons — one in 2s, two in 2p.

@continue

But a spherical 2s and two directional 2p orbitals differ in shape and energy. Three bonds from these wouldn't be identical.

So they mix. One s + two p orbitals blend into three equivalent `sp² hybrid` orbitals. This is `sp² hybridisation`.

Each sp² hybrid has ⅓ s-character and ⅔ p-character. Three equal lobes pointing toward corners of an equilateral triangle, 120° apart.

@continue

sp2-hybrid-formation.chem.svg

@continue

Each hybrid overlaps head-on with a p orbital on chlorine, forming a sigma bond. Three sigma bonds, all equal. That's BCl₃ — trigonal planar, every Cl–B–Cl angle exactly 120°.

One p orbital on boron stays unhybridised. It sits at right angles to the trigonal plane — sticking straight up and down. Empty but ready for pi bonding.

@continue

Ethene (C₂H₄) uses sp² hybridisation too. Each carbon forms three sp² hybrids — two overlap with hydrogen, one overlaps with the other carbon. Three sigma bonds per carbon.

The leftover unhybridised p orbital on each carbon overlaps sideways with the other, forming one pi bond. That gives ethene its C=C double bond — one sigma plus one pi.

The pattern: sp² hybridisation → 3 hybrid orbitals → 120° → trigonal planar geometry.


[BOND_T_029] sp³ Hybridisation

Nitrogen's ground state is 2s² 2p³. Three unpaired electrons sit in p orbitals at right angles to each other. If these pure p orbitals overlap with hydrogen, the bond angles should be 90°.

But NH₃ actually has bond angles of 107°. Pure p orbital overlap can't explain this.

Nitrogen's one 2s and three 2p orbitals mix into four `sp³ hybrid` orbitals — each with 25% s-character and 75% p-character, pointing toward the corners of a tetrahedron, 109.5° apart.

@continue

Here's the key difference from methane. Carbon uses all four sp³ hybrids for bonding. Nitrogen has only three unpaired electrons. The fourth hybrid holds a lone pair.

Three sp³ hybrids overlap with hydrogen's 1s orbitals, forming three N–H sigma bonds. The lone pair sits in the fourth hybrid, pointing away from the hydrogens.

A lone pair isn't shared with another atom. It stays closer to nitrogen, spreads out more, and pushes the bonding pairs together. The bond angle shrinks from 109.5° to 107°.

@continue

The electron pairs still sit in a tetrahedron. But the molecular shape — what you'd see if you could only see atoms — is trigonal pyramidal. Nitrogen sits on top, three hydrogens form the base.

Now look at water. Oxygen's configuration is 2s² 2p⁴. It also undergoes `sp³ hybridisation` — four sp³ hybrids arranged tetrahedrally.

But oxygen has only two unpaired electrons. Two hybrids bond with hydrogen. The other two hold lone pairs.

Two lone pairs squeeze the bonding pairs even harder than one. The H–O–H bond angle drops to 104.5° — below NH₃'s 107°.

The molecular shape is bent (also called V-shaped or angular). Two hydrogens and the oxygen form a crooked line, not a straight one.

@continue

sp3-shape-progression.chem.svg

@continue

Same hybridisation in all three. Same tetrahedral electron pairs. But the visible shapes — tetrahedral, pyramidal, bent — differ because lone pairs push bonds closer.

Each extra lone pair squeezes the angle down. Zero: 109.5°. One: 107°. Two: 104.5°.


[BOND_T_030] Multiple Bonds and Hybridisation

Carbon-carbon bonds come in three types — single, double, and triple. Going from single to triple, the bond gets shorter: 154 pm, 134 pm, 120 pm. Hybridisation explains why.

In ethane (C₂H₆), each carbon is sp³ hybridised. The C–C bond forms by sp³–sp³ overlap. C–H bonds form by sp³–s overlap. C–C = 154 pm, C–H = 109 pm.

@continue

In ethene (C₂H₄), each carbon is sp² hybridised. Three sp² orbitals make sigma bonds — one to the other carbon, two to hydrogens.

That leaves one unhybridised p orbital on each carbon. These two p orbitals overlap sideways to form a pi bond.

So the C=C double bond has two parts: one sp²–sp² sigma bond plus one p–p pi bond. Bond length: 134 pm. C–H bond length: 108 pm.

ethene-pi-bond.chem.svg

@continue

Ethene is a planar molecule. The H–C–H angle is 117.6° and the H–C–C angle is 121°.

In ethyne (C₂H₂), each carbon is sp hybridised. Two sp orbitals form sigma bonds — one to the other carbon, one to hydrogen.

Each carbon has two unhybridised p orbitals. Both pairs overlap sideways, giving two pi bonds.

The C≡C triple bond = one sp–sp sigma + two p–p pi bonds. Bond length: 120 pm. Ethyne is a linear molecule.

@continue

Why does the bond get shorter from single to triple? It comes down to s-character. sp has 50% s-character, sp² has 33%, sp³ has 25%.

s orbitals sit closer to the nucleus than p orbitals. More s-character means the hybrid is held tighter to the nucleus. So sp bonds are shorter and stronger than sp³ bonds.


[BOND_T_031] sp³d Hybridisation

What if an atom needs five bonds? Mixing s and p orbitals gives at most four hybrids. Five bonds need a fifth orbital.

Elements from the third period have d orbitals. The energy of 3d orbitals is close to 3s and 3p, so they can join the hybridisation mix.

3d energy is also close to 4s and 4p. So 3d, 4s, and 4p can hybridise together too.

But 3p and 4s are too far apart in energy. No hybridisation involving 3p, 3d, and 4s is possible.

@continue

One s, three p, and one d orbital combine to form five `sp³d hybrid` orbitals. These point toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid.

The five positions are not all equal. Three hybrids lie in a plane, 120° apart. These are the `equatorial bonds`.

Two hybrids point above and below that plane, at 90° to it. These are the `axial bonds`.

@continue

Take PCl₅. Phosphorus in its ground state is 3s² 3p³ — only three unpaired electrons. That gives just three bonds, not five.

In the excited state, one 3s electron promotes to an empty 3d orbital: 3s¹ 3p³ 3d¹. Now five singly occupied orbitals are ready to hybridise.

These five mix into sp³d hybrids. Each overlaps with a singly occupied p orbital on chlorine, forming five P–Cl sigma bonds. This is `sp³d hybridisation` — giving a trigonal bipyramidal PCl₅.

sp3d-orbital-boxes.chem.svg

@continue

Three equatorial P–Cl bonds sit at 120°. Two axial P–Cl bonds sit at 90° to the equatorial plane.

Axial bonds have three equatorial neighbors at just 90°. Equatorial bonds have only two neighbors at 90°. More close neighbors means more repulsion.

So axial bonds are slightly longer and weaker than equatorial bonds. This extra strain makes PCl₅ more reactive at its axial positions.


[BOND_T_032] sp³d² Hybridisation

Sulfur in SF₆ needs six bonds — but its ground state (3s² 3p⁴) has only two unpaired electrons. Where do six come from?

In the excited state, electrons promote into empty 3d orbitals. Now sulfur has six singly occupied orbitals: one 3s, three 3p, and two 3d.

These six orbitals mix to give six `sp³d² hybrid` orbitals — this is `sp³d² hybridisation`. All six point toward corners of a regular octahedron, every angle between neighbors 90°.

@continue

Each sp³d² hybrid overlaps with a fluorine p orbital, forming a sigma bond. Six equal S–F bonds — SF₆ has a perfect **octahedral** geometry.

sp3d2-orbital-boxes.chem.svg

@continue

Now BrF₅. Bromine is also sp³d², with six electron pairs total. But only five are bonds — the sixth is a lone pair. The lone pair takes one corner of the octahedron.

Five fluorines form a `square pyramidal` shape. Same hybridisation as SF₆, different shape — because one bonding pair was replaced by a lone pair.

@continue

XeF₄ takes it further. Xenon is sp³d² with six electron pairs — four bonds and two lone pairs.

Where do the two lone pairs sit? Opposite each other, 180° apart. Placing them next to each other (90°) would cause too much repulsion.

Four fluorines end up in a flat square. The shape is `square planar` — from an octahedral parent with two lone pairs removed.

@continue

Same hybridisation — sp³d² — gives three different shapes depending on how many lone pairs replace bonds.

Zero lone pairs: octahedral (SF₆). One lone pair: square pyramidal (BrF₅). Two lone pairs: square planar (XeF₄).

The electron pair geometry is always octahedral. The molecular shape depends on what you can see — just the atoms.


[BOND_T_NEW2] dsp² Hybridisation

sp³d² uses outer-shell d orbitals — the same shell as s and p. Now a completely different kind of hybridisation where the d orbital comes from the inner shell.

One (n−1) d orbital mixes with one ns and two np orbitals. Four hybrids form, all in a single plane at 90° to each other. This is `dsp² hybridisation`.

@continue

The 'd' is written first in dsp² — not sp²d — because that d orbital belongs to the shell below the valence shell. The notation tells you: inner d first, then outer s and p.

This is the key difference from sp³. In sp³, all four orbitals come from the same shell. In dsp², one orbital reaches down into a deeper shell.

@continue

Where does this show up? In certain metal compounds where four groups attach to a central metal ion.

Consider Ni²⁺ surrounded by four CN⁻ groups — the complex [Ni(CN)₄]²⁻. Ni²⁺ has eight d electrons spread across five 3d orbitals. In the free ion, two electrons are unpaired.

@continue

CN⁻ is a powerful group. It forces those two unpaired electrons to pair up, squeezing all eight electrons into just four 3d orbitals. One 3d orbital is now empty.

That empty 3d orbital combines with the 4s and two 4p orbitals to form four dsp² hybrids. Four CN⁻ groups each donate an electron pair into one hybrid.

@continue

dsp2-orbital-boxes.chem.svg

@continue

Result: square planar geometry. All electrons paired — the compound is **diamagnetic**. [PtCl₄]²⁻ uses the same hybridisation.

dsp² always gives square planar. sp³ always gives tetrahedral. Both have four groups around the central atom — the electronic arrangement decides which geometry forms.


[BOND_T_033] Molecular Orbital Theory: Core Ideas

VBT predicts oxygen should be diamagnetic — all electrons paired. But O₂ is paramagnetic. It's attracted to magnets. VBT can't explain this.

`Molecular orbital theory` fixes this. Its core idea: electrons don't belong to individual atoms. They belong to the entire molecule.

@continue

How do molecular orbitals form? Atomic orbitals combine. This approach is called `LCAO` — Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals.

Think of waves. Two waves can add (constructive interference) or cancel (destructive interference). Atomic orbitals behave the same way.

@continue

Constructive combination creates a `bonding molecular orbital`. Electron density piles up between the two nuclei — like glue holding them together. Both nuclei are pulled inward toward this shared cloud. Lower energy, more stable.

@continue

Destructive combination creates an `antibonding molecular orbital`. A `nodal plane` forms between the nuclei — zero electron density there. The glue is gone.

Just two bare positive nuclei left facing each other. Nothing between them except repulsion. Higher energy, less stable.

@continue

Key counting rule: number of MOs formed always equals number of AOs combined. Two atomic orbitals give one bonding MO plus one antibonding MO.

Electrons in bonding MOs hold the molecule together. Electrons in antibonding MOs tear it apart. The balance decides whether the molecule exists.


[BOND_T_034] Formation of Molecular Orbitals

Two hydrogen atoms approach. Each carries a 1s orbital. These atomic orbitals combine — but not into one. They produce two molecular orbitals with opposite effects.

Add the wave functions (ψₐ + ψᵦ). Between the nuclei, amplitudes reinforce — `constructive interference`. Electron density builds up right between the two nuclei.

This creates a bonding molecular orbital: σ1s.

@continue

That density between the nuclei is like glue. Both positive nuclei are pulled inward toward this shared electron cloud. Like both ends of a rope tugged toward a knot in the middle.

The more density in the middle, the stronger the pull holding the atoms together.

@continue

Now subtract (ψₐ − ψᵦ). Between the nuclei, amplitudes cancel — `destructive interference`. A `nodal plane` forms — zero electron density. The glue is gone.

This creates an antibonding molecular orbital: σ*1s. The asterisk (*) always marks antibonding.

@continue

With no electrons between them, the two positive nuclei face each other directly. Like charges repel. Nothing holds them together.

The electrons sit on the far sides instead, pulling each nucleus outward. Everything pushes the atoms apart.

mo-cloud-shapes.chem.svg

@continue

Look at the energy levels. The bonding MO drops below the original atomic orbitals. Electrons here sit between nuclei — glue that stabilizes.

The antibonding MO rises above. Electrons here sit outside the nuclei — they destabilize.

mo-formation.chem.svg

@continue

The drop and rise are roughly equal. Total energy is conserved.

But filling decides everything. H₂ has two electrons. Both enter the lower bonding MO. Zero electrons in the antibonding MO.

Bonding wins. The molecule is stable.


[BOND_T_035] σ and π Molecular Orbitals

Different atomic orbitals create different molecular orbitals.

From s orbitals: head-on combination gives σ (bonding) and σ* (antibonding). Electron density sits along the bond axis.

From pz orbitals (pointing along the bond axis): also head-on combination. Creates `σ2pz` (bonding) and `σ*2pz` (antibonding).

@continue

From px and py orbitals (at right angles to the bond axis): sidewise combination. Creates `π2px`, `π2py` (bonding) and `π*2px`, `π*2py` (antibonding).

Pi MOs have electron density above and below the bond axis — not directly between nuclei. They're weaker than sigma MOs.

@continue

Sigma MOs are symmetric around the bond axis. Rotate the molecule — sigma looks the same.

Pi MOs are not symmetric. They have a nodal plane along the bond axis.

For p orbitals: pz makes sigma MOs (head-on). px and py make pi MOs (sidewise). Same pattern as in VBT's sigma and pi bonds.

sigma-pi-mo-shapes.chem.svg


[BOND_T_036] MO Energy Level Diagrams

B₂ is paramagnetic — attracted to magnets. That means it has unpaired electrons. Let's see if the MO diagram predicts this.

B₂ has 10 electrons. After filling σ1s, σ*1s, σ2s, and σ*2s, we've used 8. Two electrons remain.

@continue

Head-on overlap is stronger than sideways overlap. So σ2pz should sit lower in energy than π2p. If that's true, both remaining electrons enter σ2pz — paired. Diamagnetic.

But experiments say B₂ is paramagnetic. Two unpaired electrons. Our ordering must be wrong.

@continue

Something has pushed σ2pz higher than π2p. What could do that?

Look at σ2s and σ2pz. Both are sigma-type MOs — cylindrical electron clouds wrapped around the bond axis. Same symmetry shape.

The two π MOs are different — their electron clouds sit above and below the axis. Different symmetry from σ.

@continue

Here's the rule: when two MOs have the same symmetry type and sit close in energy, they interact and push apart. The lower one drops further down, the higher one rises further up.

This is `s-p mixing`.

@continue

Think of two magnets placed on a rail, same poles facing. They push apart — one slides left, the other slides right. Same idea with same-symmetry MOs close in energy. They repel each other on the energy scale.

σ2s pushes σ2pz upward. σ2pz pushes σ2s downward. The closer they start, the stronger this push.

@continue

sp-mixing-push.chem.svg

@continue

Now the key question: how close are σ2s and σ2pz?

That depends on the gap between 2s and 2p atomic orbitals. Small gap → σ2s and σ2pz form closer together → stronger push.

In boron, carbon, and nitrogen, the 2s–2p energy gap is small. Strong mixing. σ2pz gets pushed above π2p.

@continue

In oxygen and fluorine, nuclear charge is higher. The 2s electrons get pulled much closer to the nucleus than 2p electrons. The 2s–2p gap is large.

Large gap → σ2s and σ2pz sit far apart → weak mixing → σ2pz stays below π2p, right where overlap strength predicts.

@continue

So two orderings exist.

For B₂, C₂, N₂ (small 2s–2p gap, strong mixing):

σ1s < σ*1s < σ2s < σ*2s < (π2px = π2py) < σ2pz < (π*2px = π*2py) < σ*2pz

For O₂, F₂ (large gap, weak mixing):

σ1s < σ*1s < σ2s < σ*2s < σ2pz < (π2px = π2py) < (π*2px = π*2py) < σ*2pz

Now back to B₂. With the correct ordering, π2px and π2py sit below σ2pz. The two remaining electrons enter these degenerate π orbitals.

By Hund's rule, one goes into π2px, one into π2py. Same spin. Two unpaired electrons.

Paramagnetic. Mystery solved.

@continue

π2px and π2py always have the same energy — they are `degenerate`. Same overlap, just in perpendicular planes. π*2px and π*2py are also degenerate.

Fill electrons using the same rules as atomic orbitals. Lowest energy first (Aufbau). At most 2 per MO with opposite spins (Pauli). In degenerate MOs, one electron in each before pairing (Hund's rule).


[BOND_T_037] Bond Order and Stability

Does a molecule exist? Calculate its `bond order`.

**Bond order** = ½ × (electrons in bonding MOs − electrons in antibonding MOs)

Or simply: Bond order = ½(Nb − Na)

@continue

Positive bond order means more bonding than antibonding. The molecule is stable. Higher bond order = stronger bond.

Zero or negative bond order means unstable or nonexistent. He₂ has bond order = ½(2-2) = 0. It doesn't exist.

@continue

Bond order 1 = single bond. Bond order 2 = double bond. Bond order 3 = triple bond.

Higher bond order means shorter bond length. N₂ (bond order 3) has shorter bond than O₂ (bond order 2).

Higher bond order also means higher bond enthalpy. Triple bonds are hardest to break.


[BOND_T_038] Magnetic Properties from MO Theory

MOT's biggest success is explaining magnetic behaviour.

A molecule with all electrons paired is `diamagnetic`. It's weakly repelled by magnetic fields. No unpaired electrons.

A molecule with unpaired electrons is `paramagnetic`. It's attracted to magnetic fields. The unpaired electrons act like tiny magnets.

@continue

VBT predicts O₂ should be diamagnetic. All electrons should be paired in bonds.

But the MO diagram tells a different story. O₂ has 16 electrons. Fill the MO diagram:

σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² σ2pz² π2px² π2py² π*2px¹ π*2py¹

@continue

Two electrons enter the degenerate π* orbitals. By Hund's rule, they occupy separate orbitals with parallel spins. Two unpaired electrons.

Result: O₂ is paramagnetic. This matches experiment. MOT explains what VBT couldn't.


[BOND_T_039] MO of Lighter Diatomics

Start with the simplest molecules.

H₂: two electrons. Configuration: (σ1s)². Bond order = ½(2−0) = 1. Stable single bond. Diamagnetic.

He₂: four electrons. Configuration: (σ1s)²(σ*1s)². Bond order = ½(2−2) = 0. No net bonding. He₂ doesn't exist.

He₂⁺: three electrons. Configuration: (σ1s)²(σ*1s)¹. Bond order = ½(2−1) = 0.5. This ion exists — detected spectroscopically.

@continue

Li₂: six electrons. Configuration: (σ1s)²(σ*1s)²(σ2s)². The 1s orbitals cancel out. Effective bond order = ½(2−0) = 1 from 2s.

Li₂ exists in vapour phase. It's diamagnetic.

Be₂: eight electrons. Configuration: (σ1s)²(σ*1s)²(σ2s)²(σ*2s)². All bonding canceled by antibonding. Bond order = 0. Be₂ doesn't exist.

@continue

Pattern: filled shells (like He₂, Be₂) give bond order zero. Half-filled or differently filled shells allow bonding.


[BOND_T_040] MO of B₂ through Ne₂

Now the heavier second-row diatomics. B₂, C₂, and N₂ use the alternate MO ordering where π comes before σ2pz.

[BOND_T_041] Hydrogen Bonding

Hydrogen is tiny. When it bonds to a highly electronegative atom — F, O, or N — the shared electrons shift almost entirely toward that atom.

The hydrogen becomes strongly δ+. Almost a bare proton. And bare protons are hungry for electron density.

If a nearby molecule has a lone pair on F, O, or N, that hydrogen feels attracted to it. This attraction is a `hydrogen bond`.

It's weaker than covalent or ionic bonds (about 10–40 kJ/mol). But it's stronger than other intermolecular forces.

@continue

The hydrogen acts as a bridge — covalently bonded to one atom, hydrogen-bonded to another.

h-bond-water-chain.webp

Solid line for the covalent bond. Dashed line for the hydrogen bond. Each hydrogen sits between two electronegative atoms — owned by one, reaching toward the other.

@continue

Why only F, O, and N? They're small and extremely electronegative. They create the strongest partial charges and offer the most concentrated lone pairs.

`Intermolecular hydrogen bonding` occurs between different molecules. Water molecules hydrogen-bond to each other. This explains water's unusually high boiling point.

`Intramolecular hydrogen bonding` occurs within the same molecule. In *ortho*-nitrophenol, the -OH hydrogen bonds to the nearby -NO₂ oxygen.

Intramolecular H-bonding reduces a compound's ability to form intermolecular H-bonds. *Ortho*-nitrophenol has a lower boiling point than its *para* isomer.

Hydrogen bonds shape biology. DNA's double helix. Protein folding. Water's properties. Small force, massive consequences.
