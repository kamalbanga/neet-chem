Hydrogen bonding between water molecules — showing the bridge mechanism.

THREE WATER MOLECULES arranged in a flowing chain from left to right:

Each water molecule:
- Central OXYGEN atom (bright red-orange sphere, larger)
- Two HYDROGEN atoms (small white spheres)
- Two O-H bonds as SOLID white lines (short, clear)

HYDROGEN BONDS between molecules:
- Molecule 1's right hydrogen → dashed line → Molecule 2's oxygen (left lone pair)
- Molecule 2's right hydrogen → dashed line → Molecule 3's oxygen (left lone pair)

CRITICAL VISUAL DISTINCTION:
- SOLID lines = covalent bonds (short, thick, strong)
- DASHED lines = hydrogen bonds (longer, thinner, clearly dashed)
- The difference must be instantly obvious

CHARGE LABELS (small, subtle):
- "δ+" near each hydrogen involved in H-bonding
- "δ−" near each oxygen

LONE PAIR VISUALIZATION:
- Small translucent blue-purple lobes on each oxygen
- The lone pair that ACCEPTS the H-bond should be slightly brighter — the dashed line points INTO it
- This shows WHY oxygen attracts: its lone pair provides the electron density

CALLOUT (bottom center):
Two short arrows with labels:
- Pointing to a solid O-H bond: "Covalent (~460 kJ/mol)"
- Pointing to a dashed H-bond: "H-bond (~20 kJ/mol)"

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "δ+", "δ−" (charge labels, small)
- "Covalent (~460 kJ/mol)" and "H-bond (~20 kJ/mol)" (in callout)

NO other text. NO "LEFT" or "RIGHT" labels. The visual shows the bridge concept: each hydrogen sits between two oxygens — bonded firmly to one, reaching toward the other.
