Five VSEPR shapes — ball-and-stick models showing geometry progression.

FIVE 3D ball-and-stick molecular models arranged LEFT to RIGHT in a single row, well-spaced:

1. BeCl₂ — LINEAR: Central atom with two bonds pointing in opposite directions. Straight line. Clean 180° angle visible.

2. BF₃ — TRIGONAL PLANAR: Central atom with three bonds spread flat in a triangle, 120° apart. Viewed slightly from above to show the flat arrangement.

3. CH₄ — TETRAHEDRAL: Central atom with four bonds pointing to corners of a tetrahedron. Viewed at an angle to clearly show the 3D shape. 109.5° angle.

4. PCl₅ — TRIGONAL BIPYRAMIDAL: Central atom with five bonds. Three in a horizontal triangle (equatorial), two pointing straight up and down (axial). Show the difference between equatorial and axial positions clearly.

5. SF₆ — OCTAHEDRAL: Central atom with six bonds pointing to corners of an octahedron. Four in a square plane, one up, one down. 90° angles.

All models use the same style: small colored spheres for atoms, thin sticks for bonds. Central atoms in one color, outer atoms in another. Each model should look 3D with subtle shading.

ONLY THESE LABELS (one below each model):
- "Linear" with "180°"
- "Trigonal planar" with "120°"
- "Tetrahedral" with "109.5°"
- "Trigonal bipyramidal"
- "Octahedral" with "90°"

NO molecule names. NO atom labels on the models. NO other text. Clean, simple 3D molecular geometry diagrams.
