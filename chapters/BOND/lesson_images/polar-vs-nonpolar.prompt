Two molecules showing equal vs unequal electron sharing.

TWO PANELS side by side, clearly separated:

LEFT — H₂:
Two identical small hydrogen atoms bonded. Electron density cloud shown as a soft glowing haze between and around the atoms. The cloud is PERFECTLY SYMMETRIC — centered exactly between the two nuclei. Both atoms equally wrapped in electron density.

RIGHT — HF:
Hydrogen bonded to fluorine (F atom is visibly larger). Electron density cloud SHIFTED strongly toward fluorine. The fluorine side has a dense, rich, concentrated electron cloud. The hydrogen side has a thin, sparse cloud — the atom looks exposed, almost bare.

Show "δ+" near the hydrogen in HF and "δ−" near the fluorine.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "H" and "H" (on atoms in left panel)
- "H" and "F" (on atoms in right panel)
- "δ+" (near H in right panel)
- "δ−" (near F in right panel)

NO other text. NO "LEFT" or "RIGHT" panel labels. Clean molecular diagrams with electron density shown as soft luminous clouds. The visual contrast between symmetric (H₂) and asymmetric (HF) should be immediately obvious.
