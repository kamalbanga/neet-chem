Water molecule breaking in two steps — same bond type, different energy cost.

TWO STAGES, left to right:

STAGE 1 (left):
Water molecule (H₂O) shown as ball-and-stick model with bent shape. One O-H bond highlighted and BREAKING — shown with a crack or snap effect. Energy label: "502 kJ/mol". The departing H atom moves away.

STAGE 2 (right):
The remaining OH fragment (visibly different from water — just two atoms). The remaining O-H bond highlighted and BREAKING. Energy label: "427 kJ/mol". The second H atom moves away.

Arrow between stages showing the progression.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "502 kJ/mol" (at the first breaking bond)
- "427 kJ/mol" (at the second breaking bond)
- "H₂O" (near the initial water molecule)
- "OH" (near the intermediate fragment)

NO "STAGE 1" or "STAGE 2" text rendered. NO other text. Clean, simple molecular diagrams.
