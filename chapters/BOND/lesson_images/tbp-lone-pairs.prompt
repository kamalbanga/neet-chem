Three molecular shapes from the trigonal bipyramidal parent — how lone pairs change the geometry.

THREE 3D ball-and-stick models arranged LEFT to RIGHT, showing progression:

LEFT — SF₄ (SEE-SAW):
Central sulfur atom with four fluorine atoms. One equatorial position occupied by a translucent lone pair cloud (pale blue/lavender glow). The four F atoms tilt — two axial (up/down), two equatorial (sides). The shape looks like a playground see-saw, tilted and asymmetric.

CENTER — ClF₃ (T-SHAPED):
Central chlorine with three fluorine atoms. TWO equatorial positions occupied by translucent lone pair clouds. Three F atoms remain: two axial (straight up and down) and one equatorial (sticking sideways). Forms a T shape.

RIGHT — XeF₂ (LINEAR):
Central xenon with two fluorine atoms. THREE equatorial positions all occupied by translucent lone pair clouds forming a ring around the middle. Only two axial F atoms remain — one up, one down. Perfectly linear.

Lone pair clouds should be clearly translucent/ghostly (same style as the lone pairs in the previous lp-shape-progression image — pale blue translucent lobes). Bond atoms are solid white spheres. Central atoms use different colors for each molecule.

Show the trigonal bipyramidal parent outline faintly (wireframe) in each model so students can see the original geometry being carved out.

ONLY THESE LABELS (one below each model):
- "SF₄" with "See-saw"
- "ClF₃" with "T-shaped"
- "XeF₂" with "Linear"
