Polarization of anion by cation — two panels showing before and after.

LEFT PANEL — NO POLARIZATION:
Small solid sphere representing a cation (light grey, labeled "+"). At some distance from it, a larger sphere representing an anion (soft green, labeled "−"). The anion has a perfectly round, spherical electron cloud boundary — drawn as a soft translucent green shell or glow around the anion core. The electron density is uniform all around the anion. Clean separation between the two ions.

RIGHT PANEL — POLARIZED:
Same small cation (light grey, "+"), now sitting VERY close to the anion. The anion's electron cloud is visibly distorted — stretched into an egg shape, with the pointed end bulging toward the cation. A clear concentration of electron density (brighter green or denser shading) appears in the space BETWEEN the two ions. A faint dotted circle shows where the anion's original spherical boundary was, so the student can see exactly how much it deformed.

KEY VISUAL CONTRAST between panels:
- LEFT: anion cloud is round, symmetric, undisturbed
- RIGHT: anion cloud is egg-shaped, asymmetric, bulging toward cation
- The electron density between the nuclei in the RIGHT panel is the critical feature — this is what makes the bond "covalent-like"

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "+" (on or near the cation, both panels)
- "−" (on or near the anion, both panels)
- "No polarization" (below left panel)
- "Polarized" (below right panel)

NO other text. NO arrows. NO "LEFT"/"RIGHT" labels. NO title. Clean and simple — just the two panels with their labels below.
