How lone pairs change molecular shape — tetrahedral parent morphing.

THREE 3D ball-and-stick models arranged LEFT to RIGHT, showing a clear progression:

LEFT — CH₄ (TETRAHEDRAL):
Carbon at center, four hydrogen atoms at tetrahedral corners. All four bonds visible. Perfect symmetry. Bond angle 109.5° labeled.

CENTER — NH₃ (TRIGONAL PYRAMIDAL):
Nitrogen at center, three hydrogen atoms forming a pyramid base. ONE position occupied by a lone pair shown as a soft translucent cloud/lobe (clearly different from the bond). The lone pair pushes bonds closer. Bond angle ~107° labeled.

RIGHT — H₂O (BENT):
Oxygen at center, two hydrogen atoms forming a V-shape. TWO positions occupied by lone pair clouds (same translucent style as center). Bond angle ~104.5° labeled.

All three should use the SAME viewing angle and scale so the progression is obvious. The tetrahedral electron arrangement should be visible as a faint outline or guide in all three — showing that the underlying geometry is the same, just with more lone pairs replacing bonds.

Lone pairs should be CLEARLY DIFFERENT from bonds — use a soft, translucent, colored cloud (e.g., pale blue or lavender glow) that contrasts with the solid bond sticks and atom spheres.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "CH₄" (below left)
- "NH₃" (below center)
- "H₂O" (below right)
- "109.5°" (on left model)
- "107°" (on center model)
- "104.5°" (on right model)

NO other text. NO "tetrahedral" or "pyramidal" labels. The visual progression speaks for itself — bonds disappearing, lone pair clouds appearing, angle squeezing.
