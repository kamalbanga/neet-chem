Balloon analogy for electron pair repulsion — physical intuition for molecular geometry.

THREE GROUPS arranged left to right, well-spaced:

LEFT — TWO BALLOONS:
Two inflated balloons tied together at their knots. They point in exactly opposite directions (180° apart), forming a straight line. Simple, clean.

CENTER — THREE BALLOONS:
Three inflated balloons tied together at their knots. They spread into a flat equilateral triangle (120° apart). Viewed from slightly above to show the flat arrangement.

RIGHT — FOUR BALLOONS:
Four inflated balloons tied together at their knots. They form a 3D tetrahedron (109.5° apart). Viewed at a slight angle to show the 3D arrangement clearly.

All balloons should be the SAME bright color (e.g., warm orange or yellow — visible on dark background). Each balloon is elongated/oval, like real inflated balloons.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "2 pairs → 180°" (below left group)
- "3 pairs → 120°" (below center group)
- "4 pairs → 109.5°" (below right group)

NO other text. NO "LEFT" or "CENTER" or "RIGHT" labels. Clean, simple, memorable. The visual alone should convey how pairs spread apart to maximize distance.
