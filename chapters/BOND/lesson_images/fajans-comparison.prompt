Four ion pairs showing increasing polarization — from ionic to covalent character.

HORIZONTAL ROW of four ion-pair diagrams, LEFT to RIGHT = increasing distortion.

PAIR 1 — KCl (minimal polarization):
Large grey cation (K⁺) next to medium green anion (Cl⁻). The anion's electron cloud is nearly perfectly spherical. Almost no distortion. This is the "most ionic" end.

PAIR 2 — LiCl (moderate — small cation effect):
Very small grey cation (Li⁺) next to same medium green anion (Cl⁻). The anion's cloud is slightly egg-shaped, with a subtle bulge toward the tiny cation. The small cation concentrates its charge — pulls harder.

PAIR 3 — LiI (significant — small cation + large anion):
Same very small grey cation (Li⁺) next to a LARGE purple anion (I⁻). The anion is much bigger than in pairs 1-2. Its cloud is noticeably egg-shaped, stretched toward Li⁺. Larger anion = loosely held electrons = easier to distort.

PAIR 4 — AlCl₃ (extreme — high charge):
Tiny bright-orange cation (Al³⁺, visibly smaller than Li⁺) next to medium green anion (Cl⁻). The anion's cloud is heavily distorted — dramatically egg-shaped, with a large bulge of electron density reaching toward Al³⁺. Shared density visible between the two. Almost covalent.

KEY VISUAL PROGRESSION:
- Anion cloud goes from round (pair 1) to extremely egg-shaped (pair 4)
- The bulge toward the cation grows larger with each pair
- Cation size visibly differs: K⁺ is largest, Li⁺ is small, Al³⁺ is smallest
- Anion size visibly differs: I⁻ in pair 3 is much larger than Cl⁻ in others

BELOW each pair, ONE label with the compound formula:
- "KCl"
- "LiCl"
- "LiI"
- "AlCl₃"

A horizontal arrow runs along the bottom, LEFT to RIGHT, labeled "More covalent character →"

NO other text. NO "PAIR 1" labels. NO internal annotations. Just the four ion pairs, their formula labels, and the arrow.
