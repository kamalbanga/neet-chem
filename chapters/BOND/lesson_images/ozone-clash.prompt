Ozone puzzle — what we draw vs what scientists measure.

TWO PANELS side by side, clearly separated:

LEFT PANEL — "What we draw":
Bent ozone molecule (three oxygen atoms, central O bonded to two end O's at ~120° angle).
Left bond drawn as DOUBLE bond (two parallel lines), labeled "121 pm".
Right bond drawn as SINGLE bond (one line), labeled "148 pm".
The two bonds look clearly DIFFERENT in thickness and length.

RIGHT PANEL — "What's measured":
Same bent ozone molecule, but BOTH bonds drawn identically (same thickness, same length).
Both bonds labeled "128 pm".
The two bonds look exactly THE SAME.

Between panels: a large "?" symbol emphasizing the mismatch.

ONLY THESE LABELS:
- "What we draw" (above left panel)
- "What's measured" (above right panel)
- "121 pm" and "148 pm" (on left panel bonds)
- "128 pm" and "128 pm" (on right panel bonds)

NO other text. NO "LEFT PANEL" or "RIGHT PANEL" text rendered. Simple, clean molecular diagrams.
