NaCl crystal lattice. A 4×4×4 section showing alternating spheres in a cubic pattern — smaller light-grey Na⁺ cations and larger green Cl⁻ anions. Each Na⁺ surrounded by 6 Cl⁻, each Cl⁻ by 6 Na⁺. Clean diagrammatic 3D view. ONLY THESE LABELS: "Na⁺" (pointing to one small sphere), "Cl⁻" (pointing to one large sphere). NO other text. NO title.
